- en: The second edition of *AWS Security Cookbook* discusses practical solutions
    to the most common problems faced by security consultants while securing their
    infrastructure. This book explores various AWS services and features that help
    implement security models and concepts such as the **Confidentiality, Integrity,
    and** **Availability** ( **CIA** ) triad, the **Authentication, Authorization,
    and Accounting** ( **AAA** ) triad, and non-repudiation. The book begins by getting
    you familiar with essential AWS security features such as **Identity and Access
    Management** ( **IAM** ), account aliases, and billing alerts, then delves deeper
    into access management, key management, data security, network security, web security,
    monitoring, compliance, advanced identity management, and additional security
    services and practices. Throughout the book, you will come across AWS Security
    services such as IAM, AWS Organizations, IAM Identity Center, **Key Management
    Service** ( **KMS** ), CloudHSM, S3, **Virtual Private Cloud** ( **VPC** ), CloudWatch,
    CloudTrail, Config, GuardDuty, Macie, Inspector, Security Hub, Cognito, Resource
    Access Manager, Systems Manager Parameter Store, Secrets Manager, Trusted Advisor,
    and AWS Artifact. Each chapter focuses on essential security areas and progresses
    toward cloud security best practices and integrating additional security services.
    By the end of this book, you will be adept with all of the techniques pertaining
    to securing AWS deployments along with having help to prepare for the AWS Certified
    Security – Specialty certification.

- en: '[*Chapter 1*](B21384_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor020) , *Setting up AWS Accounts
    and Organization* , introduces essential AWS security features, beginning with
    setting up the IAM service, account aliases, and billing alerts. It also covers
    multi-account management with AWS Organizations and user management with IAM Identity
    Center for centralized identity creation and access management. Completing this
    chapter prepares you for the enterprise-level AWS security management concepts
    discussed within this book.'

- en: '[*Chapter 2*](B21384_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor043) , *Access Management with IAM
    Policies and Roles* , shows how secure access management in AWS is vital for controlling
    who can access resources and what actions they can perform, ensuring the environment
    remains secure and compliant. This chapter covers IAM policies, IAM roles, and
    various policy types, providing detailed recipes for creating and managing policies,
    setting permission boundaries, and implementing cross-account and cross-service
    access. This knowledge is essential for establishing a robust and scalable security
    posture across AWS infrastructure.'

    and CloudHSM* , covers how encryption converts plain text into unreadable cipher
    text to protect messages from unauthorized access, and decryption reverses this
    process. Using AWS **KMS** and CloudHSM, this chapter covers creating, managing,
    and securing encryption keys, supporting both symmetric and asymmetric encryption.
    It includes recipes for key creation, key rotation, permissions management, and
    cross-account key sharing to ensure robust data protection in AWS.'

    Policies and Techniques* , focuses on securing Amazon S3, AWS’s object storage
    service, which uses a unique key-value system for storing data. Building on IAM
    policies from [*Chapter 2*](B21384_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor043) , we’ll explore
    securing S3 data with **Access Control Lists** ( **ACLs** ), bucket policies,
    pre-signed URLs, encryption, versioning, and replication. Recipes include creating
    bucket policies, working with ACLs, generating pre-signed URLs, protecting files
    with versioning, and encrypting S3 data.'

    with VPCs* , covers Amazon VPC, a key AWS component that enables the creation
    of private, isolated networks within the AWS cloud. Users have full control over
    their virtual network, allowing customization of IP ranges, subnets, route tables,
    and gateways. The chapter includes recipes for setting up VPC resources, creating
    subnets, launching EC2 instances, configuring security groups and NACLs, connecting
    to S3 via gateway endpoints, using VPC flow logs, and setting up NAT gateways.'

    CDNs, and Firewalls* , emphasizes web security through certificates, **Content
    Delivery Networks** ( **CDNs** ), and firewalls. It covers using X.509 certificates
    for TLS encryption, leveraging load balancers for efficient traffic distribution
    and TLS termination, and utilizing CDNs to enhance load times and security. Additionally,
    it explores firewall integration within AWS to define and enforce network security
    perimeters. Practical implementations of these components provide the knowledge
    to build a secure, scalable web infrastructure.'

    through Amazon CloudWatch, AWS CloudTrail, and AWS Config. CloudWatch handles
    logging, monitoring, and alerting; CloudTrail logs AWS API calls; and AWS Config
    evaluates configurations against rules. The chapter also covers using **Simple
    Notification Service** ( **SNS** ) for notifications and includes practical recipes
    for setting up these services and querying logs.'

    are crucial for maintaining account security. This chapter introduces AWS services
    such as Amazon GuardDuty, Amazon Macie, and Amazon Inspector, which leverage machine
    learning and advanced algorithms for compliance monitoring. It covers practical
    steps for setting up and using these services, along with AWS Security Hub and
    IAM Analyzer for comprehensive security management.'

    It covers Cognito’s user pools for user registration and authentication, identity
    pools for AWS service access, and directory solutions such as AWS Simple AD and
    integration with Microsoft Entra ID. The chapter includes practical recipes, but
    some may require additional knowledge of Microsoft products and AWS services.'
