- en: '*Becoming the Hacker* will teach you how to approach web penetration testing
    with an attacker''s mindset. While testing web applications for performance is
    common, the ever-changing threat landscape makes security testing much more difficult
    for the defender.'

- en: There are many web application tools that claim to provide a complete survey
    and defense against potential threats, but they must be analyzed in line with
    the security needs of each web application or service. We must understand how
    an attacker approaches a web application and the implications of breaching its
    defenses.

- en: Through the first part of the book, Adrian Pruteanu walks you through commonly
    encountered vulnerabilities and how to take advantage of them to achieve your
    goal. The latter part of the book shifts gears and puts the newly learned techniques
    into practice, going over scenarios where the target may be a popular content
    management system or a containerized application and its network.
