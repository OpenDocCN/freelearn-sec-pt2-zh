- en: As more organizations around the world migrate their data and their workloads
    to the cloud, engineering teams as well as security professionals face the complex
    task of securing production environments against an increasing number of cloud-related
    threats and risks. This has led to a surge in demand for security professionals
    capable of attacking and defending cloud applications and systems. Security professionals
    seeking career growth and looking to excel in their careers should learn how to
    set up various types of vulnerable-by-design lab environments in the cloud to
    sharpen their skills even further.

- en: I have written this book to help you and other professionals design, build,
    and automate penetration testing lab environments running on **Amazon Web Services**
    (**AWS**), **Microsoft Azure**, and **Google Cloud Platform** (**GCP**). You will
    learn how to automate the preparation and configuration of cloud resources using
    **Infrastructure-as-Code** (**IaC**) solutions and strategies. You will have the
    opportunity to harness the potential of **generative AI** tools to significantly
    accelerate the process of building and automating vulnerable-by-design lab environments.
    In addition to these, you will learn how to use various offensive security tools
    and techniques to validate and test the vulnerabilities and misconfigurations
    in our cloud-based labs.

    of penetration testing labs in multiple cloud platforms where you can practice
    and experiment with different types of attacks and techniques.

- en: This book is intended for security engineers, cloud engineers, and aspiring
    security professionals who want to learn more about penetration testing, cloud
    security, and infrastructure automation. It highlights the use of **Infrastructure-as-Code**
    solutions, along with **Generative AI** tools, to accelerate the preparation of
    vulnerable-by-design lab environments on **AWS**, **Azure**, and **GCP**. If you
    are planning to advance your career in cloud security and you want to learn how
    to manage the complexity, costs, and risks associated with building and managing
    hacking lab environments in the cloud, then this book is for you.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*[Chapter 1](B19755_01.xhtml)*, *Getting Started with Penetration Testing Labs
    in the Cloud*, introduces the key concepts to help you get started with building
    penetration testing labs in the cloud. In this chapter, we will also examine the
    considerations and risks involved when building these vulnerable-by-design labs
    in the cloud.'

    allows you to get your feet wet by setting up and configuring your first vulnerable
    lab environment in the cloud.'

- en: '*[Chapter 4](B19755_04.xhtml)*, *Setting Up Isolated Penetration Testing Lab
    Environments on GCP*, shows you how to isolate and protect vulnerable lab resources
    from unauthorized external attacks using a properly configured network environment.
    Inside this secure network environment, we will set up a target VM instance that
    hosts an intentionally vulnerable web application called the OWASP Juice Shop.
    In addition to this, we will launch an attacker VM instance and configure it with
    browser-based access to its desktop environment.'

- en: '*[Chapter 5](B19755_05.xhtml)*, *Setting Up Isolated Penetration Testing Lab
    Environments on Azure*, presents how to set up and automate an isolated penetration
    testing lab environment on Azure. In this chapter, we will build a lab where we
    can practice container breakout techniques to gain unauthorized access to the
    host system. In addition to this, we will look at how managed identities in Azure
    can be abused to gain unauthorized access to other cloud resources.'

    Environments on AWS*, focuses on how to build and automate the preparation of
    an isolated penetration testing lab environment on AWS. In this chapter, we will
    prepare a lab setup where we can practice pivoting techniques that can be used
    to access internal systems and networks using the initially compromised machine.'

    Lab*, demonstrates how to set up a vulnerable lab environment for IAM privilege
    escalation on AWS. In this chapter, we also have our first look into how we can
    use generative AI solutions to generate code for use in penetration testing simulations.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*[Chapter 8](B19755_08.xhtml)*, *Designing and Building a Vulnerable Active
    Directory Lab*, focuses on how to set up a vulnerable Active Directory lab on
    Azure. Here, we’ll also learn how to use various tools such as Kerbrute, Impacket,
    and John the Ripper to validate and assess whether the penetration testing lab
    environment has been set up and (mis)configured correctly.'

    presents the best practices and techniques for improving and enhancing the lab
    environments discussed in the previous chapters. In this chapter, we’ll also dive
    a bit deeper into how we can use generative AI tools for IaC template code creation,
    infrastructure cost estimation, and automation script development.'
