<span class="strong"><em class="calibre10">Building a Pentesting Lab for Wireless Networks</em></span> is a practical guide to building a penetration testing lab, accessible via Wi-Fi, which contains vulnerable components and at the same time secured from unauthorized external access. This book is intended for people learning ethical hacking and for security professionals who are responsible for penetration testing and maintaining security in their organization who wish to learn how to build a penetration testing lab for wireless networks.</p><p class="calibre9">The fact that the lab is secured from external access allows readers to use it both in corporate and home networks without putting themselves at risk. Thus, the book will be useful not only for people new to information security but also for security professionals who want to shift their expertise to the ethical hacking field. You will learn how to plan your lab, fill it with components, configure them, and secure the environment. Additionally, you will get an overview of the most popular hacking frameworks and toolsets and will be able to prepare your own wireless hacking platform on a Linux laptop or a virtual machine.</p><div class="book" title="What this book covers"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="calibre13" id="calibre_pb_1"/>

We install the most common services that you are most likely to meet in the scope of a commercial penetration testing project and which you most probably would like to be able to hack.</p><p class="calibre9">
<a class="calibre1" title="Chapter 5. Implementing Security" href="part0038_split_000.html#147LC2-3ecab517ca6e4afbb3c20ab15f7b4d82">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="strong"><em class="calibre10">Implementing Security</em></span>, shows our readers how to protect the lab network from unauthorized access and external attacks by installing and configuring network- and host-based security solutions. Additionally to securing the lab network, we prepare it for practicing important penetration testing topics, such as bypassing and evading security mechanisms and assessing their effectiveness.</p><p class="calibre9">
<a class="calibre1" title="Chapter 6. Exploring Hacking Toolkits" href="part0042_split_000.html#181NK2-3ecab517ca6e4afbb3c20ab15f7b4d82">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="strong"><em class="calibre10">Exploring Hacking Toolkits</em></span>, gives you an overview of several popular toolkits used in numerous hacking tasks and projects, along with examples of their utilization in the lab environment. It helps you get a brief understanding of their capabilities and a foundation for further learning.</p><p class="calibre9">
<a class="calibre1" title="Chapter 7. Preparing a Wireless Penetration Testing Platform" href="part0047_split_000.html#1CQAE1-3ecab517ca6e4afbb3c20ab15f7b4d82">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="strong"><em class="calibre10">Preparing a Wireless Penetration Testing Platform</em></span>, shows you how to prepare a penetration testing platform for wireless hacking, including the basic necessary tools.

<a class="calibre1" title="Chapter 8. What's Next?" href="part0053_split_000.html#1IHDQ1-3ecab517ca6e4afbb3c20ab15f7b4d82">Chapter 8</a>, <span class="strong"><em class="calibre10">What's Next?</em></span>, gives you some hints regarding what to start with and in which direction to dig if you want to develop ethical hacking skills and become a professional penetration tester.</p></div></div>
<div class="book" title="What you need for this book" id="8IL21-3ecab517ca6e4afbb3c20ab15f7b4d82"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h1 class="title" id="calibre_pb_0"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02" class="calibre1"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre9">The book will provide you with a couple of options to choose your lab architecture concept: based on hardware network devices and on a virtual network. You can vary the number of simultaneously running virtual and hardware hosts in both concepts, so the main hardware requirement is to have a computer capable of running 2-3 virtual machines simultaneously. For example, a laptop with an Intel Core i7 CPU, 8 GB RAM, and 100 GB free hard drive space is capable to fulfill all tasks.</p><p class="calibre9">Additionally, you will need a small office/home wireless router and a hardware access point (we use a Cisco IOS-based access point).</p><p class="calibre9">For the concept, based on hardware network devices, you will also need to have a manageable switch with at least 12 network ports and a manageable router with at least one Ethernet port (in our book, we use an old Cisco Router 1700 series and a Cisco Catalyst 2900 series).</p><p class="calibre9">We also mention a lot of software in the book, most of which is free, but some of it you will need to buy or use the trial versions. For the basic functionality, you will need a virtualization platform such as VMware Workstation, VMware ESX, Oracle VirtualBox, or any other that is suitable and comfortable for you. There are no exact version requirements for virtualization platforms, but in general, newer versions are better for the purposes of our book. The GNS3 software is also necessary if you will build a lab network using virtual network devices.</p><p class="calibre9">Other important non-free software that you will need are Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008, but you can also use Windows 8 to Windows 10 and Windows Server 2012.</p></div>
