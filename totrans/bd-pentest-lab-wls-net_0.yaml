- en: '*Building a Pentesting Lab for Wireless Networks* is a practical guide to building
    a penetration testing lab, accessible via Wi-Fi, which contains vulnerable components
    and at the same time secured from unauthorized external access. This book is intended
    for people learning ethical hacking and for security professionals who are responsible
    for penetration testing and maintaining security in their organization who wish
    to learn how to build a penetration testing lab for wireless networks.'

- en: The fact that the lab is secured from external access allows readers to use
    it both in corporate and home networks without putting themselves at risk. Thus,
    the book will be useful not only for people new to information security but also
    for security professionals who want to shift their expertise to the ethical hacking
    field. You will learn how to plan your lab, fill it with components, configure
    them, and secure the environment. Additionally, you will get an overview of the
    most popular hacking frameworks and toolsets and will be able to prepare your
    own wireless hacking platform on a Linux laptop or a virtual machine.

    Components*, shows you how to fill your lab with useful components, which actually
    bring sense to the whole story of building a lab network. We install the most
    common services that you are most likely to meet in the scope of a commercial
    penetration testing project and which you most probably would like to be able
    to hack.'

- en: 'The book will provide you with a couple of options to choose your lab architecture
    concept: based on hardware network devices and on a virtual network. You can vary
    the number of simultaneously running virtual and hardware hosts in both concepts,
    so the main hardware requirement is to have a computer capable of running 2-3
    virtual machines simultaneously. For example, a laptop with an Intel Core i7 CPU,
    8 GB RAM, and 100 GB free hard drive space is capable to fulfill all tasks.'

- en: Additionally, you will need a small office/home wireless router and a hardware
    access point (we use a Cisco IOS-based access point).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For the concept, based on hardware network devices, you will also need to have
    a manageable switch with at least 12 network ports and a manageable router with
    at least one Ethernet port (in our book, we use an old Cisco Router 1700 series
    and a Cisco Catalyst 2900 series).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We also mention a lot of software in the book, most of which is free, but some
    of it you will need to buy or use the trial versions. For the basic functionality,
    you will need a virtualization platform such as VMware Workstation, VMware ESX,
    Oracle VirtualBox, or any other that is suitable and comfortable for you. There
    are no exact version requirements for virtualization platforms, but in general,
    newer versions are better for the purposes of our book. The GNS3 software is also
    necessary if you will build a lab network using virtual network devices.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Other important non-free software that you will need are Windows 7 and Windows
    Server 2008, but you can also use Windows 8 to Windows 10 and Windows Server 2012.
