This order is necessary to get the most benefits from your lab environment and at the same time to stay safe from any kinds of unwanted attacks. Preliminary planning also helps to avoid an unnecessary repetition of some installation and configuration tasks that can suddenly arise during the implementation phase if you realize that something is missing or some significant changes should be done in an almost finished lab environment.</p><p class="calibre9">In this chapter, we will guide you through the whole planning phase from understanding what do you need a lab for to choosing the lab components and topology based on your own requirements. To reach this goal, we will cover the following topics in this chapter:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Understanding what tasks your lab should fulfill</li><li class="listitem">Planning the network topology</li><li class="listitem">Choosing appropriate components</li><li class="listitem">Planning lab security</li></ul></div></div>

During this education, you most likely will want to have a model of a real-world corporate network and you can emulate it in a lab.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">Improve and maintain penetration testing skills</strong></span>: Experienced professionals also need a lab to periodically try some new attack techniques, research vulnerabilities, or refresh their knowledge. Penetration testing knowledge and hacking skills tend to be forgotten or go extinct without regular practical exercises and this is equally true for pentesters and all other professions and specialties.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">Evaluate penetration testing tools and frameworks</strong></span>: You can use a lab to quickly deploy new penetration testing frameworks and attack suites, test their capabilities and convenience, their effectiveness, and result quality. It can be especially helpful when dealing with one or more commercial tools or frameworks and you need to understand is it is worth paying for, do you get what you expect from that tool, and compare several tools to decide which one you are going to buy and use. Even black-hat hackers are interested in testing various security solutions to tweak their attack tools, develop or modify malware which is not supposed to be detected or beaten by security solutions, or perform a research for the purpose of identifying and abusing new vulnerabilities in security solutions.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">Evaluate security tools and solutions</strong></span>: Normally, almost all penetration testing projects include not only hacking activities, but also a phase of developing security recommendations based on results of a test. To be able to provide deep and qualitative recommendations, a security professional has to be familiar with the recommended solutions and one of the opportunities to do so is to try security solutions himself.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">Demonstrate attacks and security risks</strong></span>: Sometimes, a customer or a company management (who is also a customer for a security specialist, but an internal one) wants to better understand risks associated with certain vulnerabilities to be able to make a correct risk-management decision. Attack demonstrations can also be very helpful in an education process when teaching <a id="id78" class="calibre1"/>other people while giving security testing classes. Various attack techniques can be demonstrated in real time or can be recorded in a lab environment and then shown in a class. As it was already mentioned earlier, seeing in an example how does an attack works increases the education quality significantly. A lot of companies worldwide maintain awareness programs to educate their employees in security to reduce the risks associated with the so-called "human factor." A lot of awareness programs face the same problem: it is hard to realize the security risks for non-security professionals, thus it is hard for them to remember and follow security rules and recommendations. Using a lab in an awareness program to demonstrate to employees the risks helps them to better understand and remember them, because they already understand what and how can happen. Another <a id="id79" class="calibre1"/>example is when a security specialist needs to demonstrate attacks and associated risks for marketing purposes.</li></ul></div><p class="calibre9">Although there are some other very specific reasons why one needs to have a lab, most of the cases usually fit into the purposes listed above and can be categorized this way.</p></div></div></div>

This is what we want to emulate in a lab—having WLANs protected in a different way for practicing wireless penetration testing and at the same time providing wireless access to a model of a real-world network for other types of hacking.</p></div><div class="book" title="Network reconnaissance"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title2"><a id="ch02lvl3sec05" class="calibre1"/>Network reconnaissance</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre9">To perform a <a id="id82" class="calibre1"/>successful penetration test, it is essential to understand a target of an attack and a network reconnaissance is the basis for that purpose. As<a id="id83" class="calibre1"/> probably the most important stage of the penetration testing, network reconnaissance is basically gathering and processing all the available information about an attack target, its features, and capabilities. Network reconnaissance can be:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">Active</strong></span>: This involves<a id="id84" class="calibre1"/> interactions with a target, by sending a specially crafted packet and the subsequent analysis of the target reaction to external impact</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">Passive</strong></span>: This <a id="id85" class="calibre1"/>does not require any interaction, and it is performed by listening to the radio and wired network traffic</li></ul></div><p class="calibre9">The goals of an activity could be:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">To collect sensitive data, which is being transmitted unencrypted, for example, the content of network frames</li><li class="listitem">To collect information about a target network topology and network protocols in use (including obsolete and dangerous protocols detection)</li><li class="listitem">To obtain versions of network services, system software, and applications</li><li class="listitem">To identify vendors and models of hardware in use</li></ul></div><p class="calibre9">The final part of <a id="id86" class="calibre1"/>a network reconnaissance is a comprehensive analysis of the gathered information suggesting potential vulnerabilities and misconfigurations of a target environment that can be exploited in order to develop an attack plan.</p><p class="calibre9">Thus, the more information you collect, the more chances of success you will have.</p></div><div class="book" title="Web application hacking"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title2"><a id="ch02lvl3sec06" class="calibre1"/>Web application hacking</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre9">Probably, the most <a id="id87" class="calibre1"/>popular and one of the most demanded topics nowadays as more and more desktop software and old-fashioned static websites migrate into web applications. That is why web application hacking became a must-have skill for professional penetration testers.</p><p class="calibre9">The list of web application attacks includes but is not limited to cross-site scripting, injection attacks, cross-site request forgery, application logic attacks, fuzzing parameters, authentication bypass, session management attacks, and more.</p><div class="informalexample" title="Note"><h3 class="title2"><a id="tip04" class="calibre1"/>Tip</h3><p class="calibre9">If you want to have a look at the currently most critical web security vulnerabilities, you can refer to the OWASP Top 10 list at <a class="calibre1" href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-Top_10">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-Top_10</a>.</p></div></div><div class="book" title="Hacking and researching network services"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title2"><a id="ch02lvl3sec07" class="calibre1"/>Hacking and researching network services</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre9">Network services (SMB, FTP, and SSH) along<a id="id88" class="calibre1"/> with their vulnerabilities and misconfigurations usually serve as gates to operating systems and not only for legitimate users. They also have their own specifics and an understanding of their operation can lead an attacker from anonymous access to control over a whole system. Improperly configured integrated OS mechanisms and permissions can also serve that purpose.</p><p class="calibre9">With network <a id="id89" class="calibre1"/>services, you can practice overflow vulnerabilities exploitation, attacking weak cryptography and weak permissions, privilege escalation, authentication bypass, credentials guessing, network reconnaissance, and other skills.</p></div><div class="book" title="AD hacking"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title2"><a id="ch02lvl3sec08" class="calibre1"/>AD hacking</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre9">Microsoft Active Directory <a id="id90" class="calibre1"/>is the key to owning a whole enterprise network and as with any technology it also has its own specifics and flaws. AD is usually very complicated to integrate and maintain in complex enterprise networks what leads to numerous misconfigurations, so it is always a juicy target for penetration testers and hackers. But some of its flaws and misconfigurations are not easy to abuse without detailed understanding of how it works and can be attacked.</p><p class="calibre9">This category implies network reconnaissance techniques, abusing group policies, stealing credentials, pass-the-hash and hash cracking attacks, and so on.</p></div><div class="book" title="DBMS hacking"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title2"><a id="ch02lvl3sec09" class="calibre1"/>DBMS hacking</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre9">DBMS surely <a id="id91" class="calibre1"/>overlaps with web application and network service hacking in some aspects, but it's a huge separate topic which includes much more than just interacting with web applications and listener security. If you want to go deeper into database hacking, there are plenty of things to research and practice.</p><p class="calibre9">DBMS hacking includes classic vulnerability exploitations, authentication bypass, and so on, but it goes deeper into DB specifics taking into account various levels of permissions, various roles, and other DBMS specifics.</p></div><div class="book" title="Network layer attacks"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title2"><a id="ch02lvl3sec10" class="calibre1"/>Network layer attacks</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre9">Network layer attacks<a id="id92" class="calibre1"/> are definitely a less popular topic, because network technologies develop less rapidly than web topics and there is an opinion that almost everything was already researched and hacked in this topic. But it is a must for every penetration tester and most of the security specialists.</p><p class="calibre9">Attacks of this group include bypassing firewalls and access control lists, breaking out of VLANs, man-in-the-middle attacks, DoS-attacks, and so on.</p><p class="calibre9">Bypassing firewalls and breaking out of VLANs have slightly different underlying attack techniques, but the goal is the same—to bypass existing access control rules and measures in order to reach normally unreachable network elements (network services, subnets, network segments, and so on) and attack or misuse them.</p></div><div class="book" title="Wi-Fi penetration testing"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title2"><a id="ch02lvl3sec11" class="calibre1"/>Wi-Fi penetration testing</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre9">As we are <a id="id93" class="calibre1"/>building a lab accessible via Wi-Fi, it would be wise to get additional benefits from it by practicing Wi-Fi penetration testing among the other tasks, especially since Wi-Fi became widespread and firmly entrenched as one of the most important enterprise technologies.</p><p class="calibre9">In the Wi-Fi topic, the following skills can be practiced: attacking WPA-PSK, attacking WPA-Enterprise, flooding, de-authentication attacks, attacking weak cryptography, WEP cracking, man-in-the-middle attacks, and sniffing attacks.</p><div class="book" title="Man-in-the-middle attacks"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h4 class="title3"><a id="ch02lvl4sec01" class="calibre1"/>Man-in-the-middle attacks</h4></div></div></div><p class="calibre9">
<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">Man-in-the-middle</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">MiTM</strong></span>) attacks <a id="id94" class="calibre1"/>are a <a id="id95" class="calibre1"/>subtype of network layer attacks, but they should be reviewed separately for wireless network connections. The first thing we should understand is that MiTM attacks make it possible to intercept network traffic by physically or virtually placing an attacking machine between a source and a target of network traffic.</p><p class="calibre9">In case of 802.11, a wireless network is a public network, and if it is unencrypted or if it has weak encryption, an attacker can intercept all data on the target wireless network, even without a logical connection. But if attackers set a rogue access point, they are able to read and modify other clients' network traffic and directly attack them (evil-twin attack) regardless of the WLAN protection type.</p><p class="calibre9">MiTM attacks in wireless networks are performed through monitoring and injecting wireless communication traffic. Thus, it is possible to attack WLANs on the first and the second levels of the OSI model. MiTM attacks are often used in conjunction with de-authentication attacks, to make a participant disconnect from the network on behalf of an access point. De-authentication attacks are also often used to carry out <a id="id96" class="calibre1"/><span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">Denial-of-Service</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">DoS</strong></span>) attacks.</p><p class="calibre9">In the case of wireless networks, DoS attacks can be a part of complex attacks on a WLAN along with social engineering attacks, MiTM attacks, attacks on authentication, and so on. But an attacker can perform a pure DoS attack intended to interrupt a WLAN service, for example, flooding a WLAN with jamming signals or garbage traffic. We have listed only the most common areas of practical security and of course, you can have your own specific tasks which you would like to perform in a lab, but in almost all cases they could be referred to one or several categories in our list.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
<div class="book" title="Planning the network topology"><div class="book" id="I3QM2-3ecab517ca6e4afbb3c20ab15f7b4d82"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h1 class="title" id="calibre_pb_0"><a id="ch02lvl1sec12" class="calibre1"/>Planning the network topology</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre9">An essential <a id="id97" class="calibre1"/>step in building a network is developing a network topology. A network topology determines how lab components can be interconnected physically and logically, significantly influences data flows inside a network and sets requirements and limitations on network protocols usage.</p><p class="calibre9">Network segmentation is another important mechanism to think about in the planning stage. A network segmentation allows us to implement network management protocols to practice more network layer attacks, and it allows us to use integrated security features of network devices and dedicated network-based firewalls to provide better inter-segment isolation and network access control.</p><p class="calibre9">Thus, if you<a id="id98" class="calibre1"/> want to implement certain network protocols operating in a lab, which make sense with practicing certain attack types and provide security to the lab at the same time, we need to plan a segmental lab's network with several subnets and virtual LANs instead of just connecting all lab components to one switch. We are not going to implement the security measures mentioned earlier, but we will implement some network segmentation to secure the lab and allow you to improve the lab security later if you want.</p><p class="calibre9">Lab environment security is also highly dependent on a network topology that is implemented in a lab, so we should state general security requirements before we start to plan subnets and network segments:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">We need to keep our internal network segments insecure to allow practice various attacks and, at the same time, we do not want to see somebody unauthorized accessing our lab whatever intentions they may have</li><li class="listitem">The lab should be accessible for authorized users and devices via a protected WLAN, but it should be also possible to connect testing machines directly to the lab LAN to practice certain network attacks</li></ul></div><p class="calibre9">After we have understood our lab security requirements, let's proceed with defining subnets and network segments which we would like to have in our lab.</p><p class="calibre9">It is common practice to separate server and user workspaces in enterprise networks and assign different IP ranges to them. That is what we are going to implement to imitate a real network. Additionally, we are going to establish a separate management VLAN for managing servers—again, as in a real enterprise network. This will allow you to practice attack scenarios such as getting management access to a server after privilege escalation on a normal user workstation or build a network tunnel from a hacker's machine to a management interface of a network device via a hacked server.</p><p class="calibre9">Usually, large companies want to provide Internet access to their visitors and still keep their internal networks safe from the possible risks associated with untrusted connections. Such risks can be represented, for example, by intended malicious behavior or even non-intended malware spreading from visitor devices. </p><p class="calibre9">To minimize those risks, companies usually implement guest network segments. They are normally logically or physically isolated from other enterprise networks and network segments but allow visitors to access the Internet. With the high popularity of mobile devices, WLAN became the most convenient and widely spread technology for guest networks.</p><p class="calibre9">We also would like<a id="id99" class="calibre1"/> to have a guest WLAN in the lab and mostly because we don't want to ever switch our trusted WLAN in a less secure mode than the one which protects our lab in the best way. Our lab is supposed to be accessible mostly via Wi-Fi (remember the book's name?) but to be vulnerable inside, so it a very important point to do not reduce the security of the trusted WLAN.</p><p class="calibre9">Taking into account all requirements provided previously along with the idea to imitate a real network without building a huge and expensive infrastructure, let's design a lab with a popular scheme for small offices called <a id="id100" class="calibre1"/><span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">Router-on-a-Stick</strong></span>. It is assumed in this scheme that the whole network is built on two network devices: a switch and a router that is connected just to one port on a switch.</p><p class="calibre9">The Router-on-a-Stick scheme assumes that a local network is connected to an external network (or ISP) via only one designated and logically isolated switch port. Please keep in mind that everything outside this port is an untrusted environment. The guest WLAN subnet is also an untrusted network environment because it is exposed to the air and destined for connecting untrusted devices.</p><p class="calibre9">We think it is a good idea for a lab to join untrusted network areas and connect the guest WLAN via a SOHO Wi-Fi router.</p><p class="calibre9">If you decide to get an additional network-based firewall with an IPS module, a good place to install it is between a SOHO and a core routers. Thus, it will become an additional layer of security and will protect the internal lab network against attacks originated from external and guest networks.</p><p class="calibre9">To better represent all the ideas described till now, let's depict the resulting network topology in a diagram:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/00008.jpeg" alt="Planning the network topology" class="calibre11"/><div class="caption"><p class="calibre15">The lab network topology diagram</p></div></div><p class="calibre12"> </p><p class="calibre9">As the last step, let's define an addressing scheme for our network.</p><p class="calibre9">The server <a id="id101" class="calibre1"/>subnet will have static IP addresses as in real networks and the user subnet can operate a DHCP server to provide dynamic IP addresses to workstations. The guest network and the trusted WLAN should also assign dynamic IP addresses. You can find the IP ranges for each subnet in the following list:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">Server subnet</strong></span>: 10.0.0.0/24</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">User subnet</strong></span>: 172.16.0.0/24</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">Guest WLAN</strong></span>: 192.168.0.0/24</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">Trusted WLAN</strong></span>: 172.16.1.0/24</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">Management VLAN</strong></span>: 10.1.0.0/24</li></ul></div><p class="calibre9">So, the network topology has been developed and we can continue with choosing lab components.</p></div>

<div id="page" style="height:0pt"/><div class="book" title="Choosing appropriate components" id="J2B81-3ecab517ca6e4afbb3c20ab15f7b4d82"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h1 class="title" id="calibre_pb_0"><a id="ch02lvl1sec13" class="calibre1"/>Choosing appropriate components</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre9">Under this topic, we<a id="id102" class="calibre1"/> are going to decide which lab components can fulfill the tasks determined in the previous topic.</p><p class="calibre9">As it is not always easy to get enough budget and hardware to build a penetration testing lab in an enterprise environment and even harder to do it at home, we are going to use virtualization and free software as much as possible in this book. That decision influences the next topics significantly, because it sets additional requirements for a lab.</p><p class="calibre9">Virtualization has also another significant advantage—flexibility to quickly modify the lab environment content according to current tasks by simply turning virtual hosts on and off.</p><p class="calibre9">For a virtual lab, you will need a computer powerful enough to run three to four virtual machines at the same time. We would recommend having at least four cores CPU and 8 GB of RAM. Additionally, you will need at least 150 GB of free space on a hard drive. Of course, if you have a bigger hard drive and if it is an SSD drive, your lab will work much better.</p><p class="calibre9">If you are going to build the lab on hardware network devices, it is better to have a couple of computers (probably less powerful, than the one described in the previous paragraph) to connect them to various switch ports and run VMs in different VLANs at the same time. But you will need them for a limited number of lab tasks only. If you have an opportunity to deploy a hardware virtualization platform based on a hypervisor such as ESXi or Xen with enough resources to run five to six virtual machines at once, it would be even better.</p></div>

Of course, each of the options has its own advantages and disadvantages.</p><p class="calibre9">The <a id="id104" class="calibre1"/>main advantage of using hardware devices is getting very good performance, but the disadvantages are obvious: usually you need to pay for them, they are pretty noisy and they consume additional electricity.</p><p class="calibre9">The advantage of virtual network devices is their price and flexibility, but you can experience a lack of performance.</p><p class="calibre9">In our examples, we will use an old Cisco 1700 Series router and a Cisco 2900 Series switch for a hardware option (see the following image) and GNS3 as a free solution for virtual network devices.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/00009.jpeg" alt="Network devices" class="calibre11"/><div class="caption"><p class="calibre15">The Cisco switch and router</p></div></div><p class="calibre12"> </p><div class="informalexample" title="Note"><h3 class="title2"><a id="tip05" class="calibre1"/>Tip</h3><p class="calibre9">Alternatively, you can use virtual network devices from the company Brocade, but they are not free and we have not tried them.</p></div><p class="calibre9">We will also employ two Wi-Fi access points: a simple and cheap SOHO Wi-Fi router for a guest WLAN, Internet connection, and a Cisco AIR-AP521G-E-K9 access point for a trusted WLAN.

For example, some Linksys routers support it.</p></div><p class="calibre9">If your <a id="id105" class="calibre1"/>budget permits, you can buy newer devices and a separated network firewall with an IPS module to provide higher security for our internal lab network, but we will not cover these topics in this book.</p></div></div>

In our case, we are going to implement Microsoft Active Directory solution for such a centralized infrastructure management imitation.</p><p class="calibre9">Other lab <a id="id108" class="calibre1"/>components will serve certain application and representation-level tasks and we want to provide our readers with a certain level of flexibility during the lab building process in order to be able to customize the lab environment according to your own tasks and requirements.</p><p class="calibre9">A very comfortable and fast way to plan such customization is to create a self-explanatory table that will allow us to quickly define the correspondence between lab components and the certain tasks they allow us to fulfill:</p><div class="informalexample"><table border="1" class="calibre16"><colgroup class="calibre17"><col class="calibre18"/><col class="calibre18"/></colgroup><thead class="calibre19"><tr class="calibre20"><th valign="bottom" class="calibre21">

Obviously, we do not want to become somebody's victim due to the fact that we intentionally leave a lot of vulnerabilities in a lab environment.</p><p class="calibre9">At the same time, practicing security evasion techniques is definitely important for penetration testers and security specialists, especially for developing their skills to the advanced level.</p><p class="calibre9">According to our general security requirements and the purpose of building a lab, we are going to configure maximal security at the entry points to our lab network: at the gateway and at the trusted WLAN.</p><p class="calibre9">Further, we want to define the lab security requirements in detail and group them by areas.</p></div>

<div class="book" title="Planning lab security">
<div class="book" title="Access control"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title1" id="calibre_pb_1"><a id="ch02lvl2sec19" class="calibre1"/>Access control</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre9">Access control <a id="id110" class="calibre1"/>is a powerful measure that allows us to enforce security if it is designed and configured properly. At the same time, it increases network complexity making attacks more sophisticated and providing the ability to make hacking exercises more interesting and more useful in the meaning of acquired skills.</p><p class="calibre9">For the purposes of our lab, access control can be represented at two main levels: network-based, implemented on network devices, and host-based, implemented on network hosts.</p><p class="calibre9">Keeping that in mind, let's define network-based access control requirements:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">If we are going to let our lab components access the Internet, but leave them directly inaccessible in the other direction (from the Internet), we should use <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">network address translation</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">NAT</strong></span>) technology at the both of our routers.</li><li class="listitem">Workstations should be accessible from the server segment without any limitations.</li><li class="listitem">To protect our internal lab from unauthorized intrusion through a guest WLAN, the internal network should not be accessible from the guest subnet at all, as well as the guest WLAN should not be accessible from the internal network. Untrusted guest devices should be able to only access Internet.</li><li class="listitem">To allow all attacks, the whole network should be accessible for authenticated WLAN users without any limitations.</li></ul></div><p class="calibre9">If<a id="id111" class="calibre1"/> correctly implemented, these access control rules combined with the chosen network topology will significantly rise our lab's security and bring practicing network attacks to a higher level.</p></div></div>

<div class="book" title="Planning lab security">
<div class="book" title="Integrated security mechanisms"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title1" id="calibre_pb_2"><a id="ch02lvl2sec20" class="calibre1"/>Integrated security mechanisms</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre9">The <a id="id112" class="calibre1"/>security of any infrastructure can be measured by its weakest component. Therefore, protection of the infrastructure should consist of several levels and only the complex protection can provide a high level of security. It is important to understand that information security systems consist not only of information security imposed solutions, but also of integrated security mechanisms built-in to components of an infrastructure.</p><p class="calibre9">To review and choose built-in security mechanisms, we will use an approach going up from low to high and from hardware to software levels.</p><p class="calibre9">Often, cheap wired network devices have a limited set of basic security mechanisms, such as access control mechanisms and basic traffic filtering (simple rule-based firewalling capabilities), for example, access filtering based on MAC-address values. But in most cases, these measures will be sufficient to significantly reduce security violation risks and to protect from self-distributing malicious software and potential attackers with an average skill level.</p><p class="calibre9">It is important to mention that network devices have management interfaces which should be protected very properly because they possess great risks for the whole network infrastructure. Usually, there are several such interfaces available by various network ports (Telnet, SSH, and Web) and access to these interfaces is granted by a combination of login and password. Also, if a potential attacker gains access to these interfaces, the consequences could be painful for the infrastructure up to intercepting business critical information and interrupting all network services of the entire company.</p><p class="calibre9">According to our security requirements, we are going to use integrated security mechanisms in different ways on the network entry points (gateway and wireless access points) which have to be protected and on the internal network devices that have to be vulnerable for training purposes.</p><p class="calibre9">We will list all built-in security features configured by default on internal network devices and will configure the following ones on the network entry points:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Strong network-based access control</li><li class="listitem">Strong password policies for authentication</li><li class="listitem">Event logging</li><li class="listitem">Encrypted management communications where possible (HTTPS and SSH)</li></ul></div><p class="calibre9">The next<a id="id113" class="calibre1"/> level of a network abstraction is hosts (servers and workstations). When we consider all the hosts from the information security point of view, we consider their operating systems. In the context of security issues, an operating system is a system software with a set of local and network services that provide interaction between a user and an infrastructure. Needless to say, modern operating systems come with a set of built-in security features, which are primarily aimed at protection against unauthorized access. Here are some of the typical security features:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Identification and authentication (account management, password policies, and so on)</li><li class="listitem">Authorization<div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist1"><li class="listitem">Access differentiation to data stores</li><li class="listitem">Access control to software installation and software execution</li><li class="listitem">Access control to OS services management</li><li class="listitem">Access control to change OS and system applications settings</li></ul></div></li><li class="listitem">Network activity filtration (built-in firewalls)</li><li class="listitem">Integrity control of OS system data</li><li class="listitem">Event logging</li></ul></div><p class="calibre9">In our lab, we will have to distinguish host configurations based on two roles, the server and workstation, since there are functional differences.</p><p class="calibre9">To allow analysis and investigation of security incidents and attacks, event logging subsystem should be also activated on all hosts. In the case of the server, event logging should be more detailed than on the workstation, for example, it is important to log successful or failed attempts to login. A more interesting event for logging on workstations is periodical stopping and starting of services, because it is very likely a malware activity.</p><p class="calibre9">Information systems that will be used in our testing infrastructure generally have a minimum set of security mechanisms. Usually, these are authentication, access control and event logging. The set of security mechanisms and possible settings in each information system is individual.</p><p class="calibre9">Built-in security mechanisms configured by default on modern Windows and Linux workstations provide a sufficient level of security for our needs. Therefore, we are going to let them stay as is in most cases, but we will enforce workstation security with additional third-party security solutions that we will discuss in the next topic.</p><p class="calibre9">As we are going to have all servers and workstations as virtual machines, it is wise to use such a convenient virtualization feature as a snapshot. A snapshot is basically a saved system state which can be quickly restored. We recommend that you have at least two security states saved in snapshots. The first one is less secure for practicing simple and medium complicated attacks on it, and the second one will be used for practicing advanced <a id="id114" class="calibre1"/>attack techniques or in cases when you do not need to attack this host at the moment, but it should be turned on to provide some services to other hosts being attacked.</p></div></div>

The intention to practice security evasion and breaking techniques along with the idea to imitate a real enterprise network with our lab are other fundamental requirements for implementing additional security solutions.</p><p class="calibre9">First of all, we need to secure the access to the WLAN which will be used to connect authorized users to the lab environment. We will configure WPA-Enterprise with mutual digital certificate-based authentication as the most secure solution and use a RADIUS server with FreeRADIUS software for that purpose. This is a free and open source software providing us a lot of authentication options and it is relatively easy to configure.</p><p class="calibre9">An additional security for some workstations will be provided by <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">host-based IDPS</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">HIDPS</strong></span>) and antivirus solutions installed on them. It will also let you practice existing or developing new security evasion attack techniques. We will use free HIDPS with antivirus features developed by COMODO because it has all the necessary capabilities and is not complicated in configuration.</p></div></div>

Security hints will be provided separately because normally they do not belong to the main content of the book, but in our opinion they are still worth mentioning and emphasizing.</p><p class="calibre9">So, let's present the first security hints:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Despite that we apply a lot of security features in the lab, it still contains a lot of vulnerabilities and you are going to test dangerous tools that can be unpredictable sometimes, so we recommend you to connect your lab to an external network or the Internet only when it is really necessary.</li><li class="listitem">Interoperability with third-party devices should be minimized. For this purpose, access points should be placed in a controlled area. Additionally, signal ranges of our WLANs should be limited, for example, by reducing a signal power of an access point.</li><li class="listitem">If you need to practice hacking WEP or other weak network security mechanisms, it is wise to save a safe configuration of affected devices and revert to it after practicing to do not forget to configure some important parameters into their safe values.</li><li class="listitem">When<a id="id117" class="calibre1"/> practicing WEP and WPA-PSK hacking, it is wise to physically disconnect a Wi-Fi router from a lab network, so nobody will be able to hack your lab during that time when it stays poorly protected while you are practicing.</li></ul></div></div>
