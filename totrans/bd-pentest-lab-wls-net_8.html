This approach can bring some knowledge and skills, but it does not allow you to develop them systematically and comprehensively. We believe that a person who has learned just several attack techniques without a proper background preparation cannot reliably perform a penetration test and will identify only a part of all vulnerabilities and security flows in a target system or infrastructure.</p><p class="calibre9">Thus, it is essential for penetration testers to constantly improve their skills to be able to identify not only the common security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, but also identify atypical ones using deep technology understanding and their own acquired experience.</p><p class="calibre9">Let's briefly introduce you to the main penetration testing domains (topics) you might be interested in.</p></div></div>

Additionally, web applications are often developed in-house and the development process is not standardized as well, as not all developers are aware about secure coding. Altogether, it brings a lot of opportunities for investigation and research for penetration testers such as standard vulnerability types and often much more interesting things like juicy flaws in application logic.</p><p class="calibre9">A good <a id="id601" class="calibre1"/>source to start is the book <span class="strong"><em class="calibre10">The Web Application Hacker's Handbook, Second Edition</em></span>, <span class="strong"><em class="calibre10">Dafydd Stuttard and Marcus Pinto</em></span>, <span class="strong"><em class="calibre10">Wiley</em></span>.

Visit <a class="calibre1" href="https://www.owasp.org">https://www.owasp.org</a> for more information. You should also check out the OWASP Top 10 and OWASP Testing Guide.</p><p class="calibre9">We recommend you to use the web applications installed in the lab and start filling Liferay Portal with content to analyze how it works. We also recommend you to install additional popular web applications like Kentico CMS, for example. If you know which web applications are popular in enterprise networks in your region, try installing and hacking them. It will be definitely an advantage when you proceed to real projects.</p></div></div></div>

They all have security flaws. Some of the flaws allow harmless pranks, some of them allow data leakage or hidden surveillance, and some of them allow attackers to get inside a network. It will be worse with the further popularity of IoT when almost all or maybe all electronic devices have Internet connections.</p><p class="calibre9">To go deep in this topic, we believe you should learn the other ones from our list first.
