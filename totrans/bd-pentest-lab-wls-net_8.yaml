- en: Needless to say, it is definitely not enough to just build a lab and try to
    use it without any certain plan and proper learning. This approach can bring some
    knowledge and skills, but it does not allow you to develop them systematically
    and comprehensively. We believe that a person who has learned just several attack
    techniques without a proper background preparation cannot reliably perform a penetration
    test and will identify only a part of all vulnerabilities and security flows in
    a target system or infrastructure.
  prefs: []

    to be able to identify not only the common security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations,
    but also identify atypical ones using deep technology understanding and their
    own acquired experience.

    of all penetration testing projects are aimed on web application or service security
    assessment.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although the topic may seem very narrow at first, it is actually very broad
    due to the number of available platforms, frameworks, and technologies used. Additionally,
    web applications are often developed in-house and the development process is not
    standardized as well, as not all developers are aware about secure coding. Altogether,
    it brings a lot of opportunities for investigation and research for penetration
    testers such as standard vulnerability types and often much more interesting things
    like juicy flaws in application logic.

    region, try installing and hacking them. It will be definitely an advantage when
    you proceed to real projects.

    so. We can see that not only laptops, tablets, and mobile phones are connected
    to SOHO networks, but also smart fridges, coffee machines, TVs, audio systems,
    thermostats, and so on. They all have security flaws. Some of the flaws allow
    harmless pranks, some of them allow data leakage or hidden surveillance, and some
    of them allow attackers to get inside a network. It will be worse with the further
