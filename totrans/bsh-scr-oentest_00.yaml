- en: Bash shell scripting is a fundamental skill in the pentester’s toolkit, enabling
    the automation of complex security assessments, vulnerability analysis, and exploitation
    tasks. This book provides a comprehensive guide to mastering Bash scripting specifically
    for pentesting, covering everything from basic scripting concepts to advanced
    techniques for evading detection and integrating with modern technologies such
    as artificial intelligence (AI).

- en: The book is structured in three parts, taking readers from foundational concepts
    through practical pentesting applications to advanced topics. You’ll learn how
    to leverage Bash for reconnaissance, web application testing, network infrastructure
    assessment, privilege escalation, and maintaining persistence. The book emphasizes
    hands-on learning with practical examples and real-world scenarios that pentesters
    encounter in their daily work.
