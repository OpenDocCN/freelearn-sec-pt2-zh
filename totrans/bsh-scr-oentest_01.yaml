- en: In this part, you will establish a solid foundation in Bash scripting specifically
    tailored for pentesting. Beginning with setting up a proper hacking environment
    and configuring the Bash shell, this section progresses through essential file
    and directory management techniques needed for security assessments. You will
    master core programming concepts, including variables, conditionals, loops, and
    arrays, before diving into pattern matching with regular expressions – a crucial
    skill for parsing security tool outputs. The section then advances to function
    creation and script organization, ensuring you can build maintainable, professional-grade
    security tools. Moving into networking fundamentals, you will learn how Bash interacts
    with network services and protocols. The section concludes with parallel processing
    techniques, enabling you to develop efficient scripts that can handle multiple
    tasks simultaneously – an essential capability for large-scale security assessments.
    By the end of *Part 1* , you will have all the fundamental skills needed to begin
    writing sophisticated security-focused Bash scripts.
