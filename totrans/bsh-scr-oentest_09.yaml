- en: In this part, you will apply your foundational Bash scripting knowledge to real-world
    pentesting scenarios. Starting with reconnaissance and information gathering,
    you will learn to automate the discovery of target assets, including DNS enumeration,
    subdomain mapping, and OSINT collection through Bash scripts. The section then
    progresses into web application testing, where you will develop scripts for automating
    HTTP requests, analyzing responses, and identifying common web vulnerabilities.
    Moving deeper into infrastructure testing, you will create scripts for network
    scanning, service enumeration, and vulnerability assessment automation. The focus
    then shifts to post-exploitation techniques, with chapters dedicated to privilege
    escalation scripting, maintaining persistence, and network pivoting â€“ all orchestrated
    through Bash. The section concludes with a comprehensive look at pentest reporting
    automation, teaching you how to transform raw tool outputs and findings into professional,
    actionable reports using Bash scripts. Throughout *Part 2* , each chapter builds
    upon the previous ones, culminating in a complete toolkit of custom Bash scripts
    for conducting thorough pentests.
