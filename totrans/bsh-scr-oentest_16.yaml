- en: In this part, you will explore cutting-edge applications of Bash scripting in
    modern pentesting scenarios. This final section begins with sophisticated evasion
    and obfuscation techniques, teaching you how to craft Bash scripts to bypass antivirus
    and endpoint detection systems while maintaining operational effectiveness. The
    section then ventures into the intersection of **artificial intelligence** ( **AI**
    ) and pentesting, showing how to leverage Bash scripts to interact with AI models
    for enhanced vulnerability detection and automated decision-making during security
    assessments. Finally, you will learn to integrate your Bash scripting expertise
    into DevSecOps workflows, including automating security tests in CI/CD pipelines
    and creating custom, security-focused Kali Linux builds. This advanced section
    challenges you to push the boundaries of traditional Bash scripting, preparing
    you for emerging trends in the cybersecurity landscape while maintaining a focus
    on practical, real-world applications that can be immediately implemented in professional
    pentesting engagements.
