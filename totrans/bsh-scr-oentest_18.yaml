- en: The integration of AI in pentesting poses a number of ethical and practical
    challenges that security professionals must face. As we use AI to enhance our
    capabilities, we also open a Pandora’s box of complex ethical dilemmas and practical
    challenges.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: From an ethical standpoint, the use of AI in pentesting raises questions about
    accountability and responsibility. When an AI system identifies a vulnerability
    or suggests an exploit, who bears the responsibility for the actions taken based
    on that information – the pentester, the AI developer, or the organization deploying
    the AI? This ambiguity in accountability could lead to situations where ethical
    boundaries are inadvertently crossed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another ethical concern is the potential for AI systems to make decisions that
    could cause unintended harm. For instance, an AI system might recommend an exploit
    that, while effective, could cause collateral damage to systems not intended to
    be part of the test. Human oversight is critical in such scenarios to ensure that
    the AI’s actions align with the agreed-upon scope and rules of engagement.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: From a practical perspective, the implementation of AI in pentesting presents
    its own set of challenges. One significant hurdle is the quality and quantity
    of the data required to train effective AI models. Pentesting often deals with
    unique, context-specific scenarios, making it challenging to acquire sufficient
    relevant data for training. This limitation could lead to AI systems that perform
    well in controlled environments but stumble in real-world, complex networks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There’s also the issue of transparency and explainability. Many AI systems,
    particularly deep learning models, operate as *black boxes* , making it difficult
    to understand how they arrive at their conclusions. In the context of pentesting,
    where findings need to be validated and explained to clients, this lack of transparency
    could be a problem. It may be necessary to develop AI systems that can provide
    clear reasoning for their recommendations, allowing human testers to verify and
    explain the results.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: My top two highest concerns during a pentest are protecting the sensitive data
    I’m entrusted with and doing no harm to the systems I’m testing. In the context
    of AI, this means that I cannot hand over any sensitive or identifying data to
    a third-party AI product, and I am responsible for verifying the safety and accuracy
    of any data, programs, and commands that are suggested by the AI system before
    I execute them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To put this into context, let’s imagine for a moment that we’re on a pentest
    and we want to give AI a try in the hopes that it provides us with an edge. First,
    let’s set some boundaries and make some decisions. The number one consideration
    is if the data we submit to the AI agent leaves our control. If you have trained
    your own ML/AI system and you have the service contained internally, and you have
    also ensured that there are no external connections to the internet, it may be
    appropriate to submit unredacted data to the AI agent. On the other hand, if you’re
    using an external AI agent such as ChatGPT or Claude.ai (or any others not under
    your control), you should not be submitting your pentest data to them. Ultimately,
    this ethical dilemma should be discussed between you, your employer, and your
    legal department to establish policies and guardrails.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The other consideration is verifying the accuracy of the data returned from
    the AI agent. You are responsible for every command and program that you run during
    a pentest. Just as you should be very careful about running any exploit code and
    first review it to ensure that it’s trustworthy, the same goes for anything suggested
    by AI. AI agents are not infallible. They do make mistakes. I recommend that you
    never create or use any AI system that can run programs or commands on your behalf.
    You must carefully consider the accuracy and safety of every step in your pentest
    workflow before you execute it.

    that we approach its implementation with careful consideration of both ethical
    and practical implications.

    blocks of text that AI models work with. Imagine you’re reading a book, but instead
    of it being made up of full words, you’re seeing fragments of words and sometimes
    full words. These fragments or words are what we call tokens in AI. They’re the
    units that the AI processes and understands.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Tokenization** , the process of breaking text into these tokens, is a critical
    step for several reasons. First, it helps standardize the input for AI models.
    Different languages and writing systems can be complex, but by breaking them down
    into tokens, we create a common language that the AI can work with efficiently.
    It’s like translating various languages into a universal code that the AI understands.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Second, tokenization helps manage the computational load. AI models, especially
    LLMs, are incredibly complex and require a lot of processing power. By working
    with tokens instead of raw text, we can control the input size and make the processing
    more manageable. It’s similar to how we might break down a large project into
    smaller, more manageable tasks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    words or phrases might have different meanings in different contexts, and by breaking
    them down into tokens, we give the AI model the flexibility to interpret them
    more accurately based on the surrounding tokens.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The outcome of using AI can be frustrating or disappointing without knowledge
    of how to use it properly. A **prompt** is a specific input or instruction given
    to an AI system to elicit a desired response or output. Your results can vary
    considerably based on the effort you put into your prompt. Another issue is that
    AI models typically resist answering questions about hacking due to ethical and
    legal concerns. We’ll address both issues in this section.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Effective prompting is extremely important to get the best results from AI systems.
    There are several types of prompts you can use, each suited for different purposes.
    Instructional prompts are straightforward and direct the AI to perform a specific
    task or provide information on a particular topic. These are useful when you need
    a clear, focused response. Examples are **Explain common nmap scan options** or
    **Write a Bash script that uses curl to query** **a URL** .
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Open-ended prompts, on the other hand, allow for more creativity and exploration.
    These can be used to generate ideas or discuss complex topics from multiple angles.
    An example might be, **What are some potential implications of widespread AI adoption
    in the cybersecurity industry?** . This type of prompt encourages the AI to consider
    various aspects and provide a more thoughtful response.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When creating prompts, it’s important to be clear and specific. Provide context
    when necessary and break down complex queries into smaller, more manageable parts.
    This helps ensure that the AI understands your request and can provide a more
    accurate and relevant response. You’ll get the best results from AI when you provide
    it with more context and guardrails on what you expect in the output.

    typically not visible to the end user but guides the AI’s responses throughout
    the interaction. It can include instructions on the AI’s persona, the scope of
    its knowledge, any limitations or ethical guidelines it should follow, and the
    general tone or style of its responses.

    we can ask follow-up questions related to a previous answer, setting **num_ctx**
    to **0** is not ideal. There are two ways to erase an Ollama model’s memory of
    your conversations so that you can start over and retain future conversation context
    so it forgets that it denied your previous requests due to ethical concerns. The
    first way is to send an API request with the **context** parameter value set to
    **null** . The second way is to restart the Ollama service using the **sudo systemctl
    restart** **ollama** command.

    your conversation, there’s another way I find it’s frequently helpful. Despite
    changing the system prompt and reassuring the agent that my purposes are legal
    and ethical, every so often, I experience the agent rejecting my request for legal
    and ethical reasons. When this occurs, I simply send a prompt that reminds the
    agent of its system programming, which includes the fact that I am always acting
    legally and ethically and have permission to test my duties as a security consultant.
    This results in the agent dutifully answering my questions.

    , I added a **temperature** parameter. This parameter controls the randomness
    of the model’s responses. Lower values (e.g., **0.2** ) make the model more deterministic,
    while higher values (e.g., **0.8** ) make responses more creative. The default
    value for the Ollama **temperature** parameter is **1.0** . The minimum value
    is **0** and the maximum is **2.0** . I’ll use a **temperature** value of **0**
    when I need very logical answers and use **1.0** when I want the agent to be more
    creative.

    This parameter is a **Boolean** (true or false value) that controls whether the
    output is streamed one character or word at a time (true) or whether the API waits
    for the full output before returning the API response (false). You must set it
    to **false** if you’re querying the API using a Bash script.
