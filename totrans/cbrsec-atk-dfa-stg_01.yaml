    have*, and now organizations around the globe are realizing how important it is
    to continually invest in security. This investment will ensure that the company
    stays competitive in the market. Failure to properly secure their assets could
    lead to irrepairable damage, and in some circumstances could lead to bankruptcy.
    Due to the current threat landscape, investing only in protection isn't enough.
    Organizations must enhance their overall security posture. This means that the
    investments in protection, detection, and response must be aligned.

    that are available today, the threats are evolving rapidly to exploit different
    aspects of these technologies. Any device is vulnerable to attack, and with **Internet
    of Things** (**IoT**) this became a reality. In October 2016, a series of **Distributed
    Denial of Service** (**DDoS**) attacks were launched against DNS servers, which
    caused some major web services to stop working, such as GitHub, Paypal, Spotify,
    Twitter, and others (1).

    While the use of IoT to launch a massive cyber attack is something new, the vulnerabilities
    in those devices are not. As a matter of fact, they've been there for quite a
    while. In 2014, ESET reported 73,000 unprotected security cameras with default
    passwords (2). In April 2017, IOActive found 7,000 vulnerable Linksys routers
    in use, although they said that it could be up to 100,000 additional routers exposed
    to this vulnerability (3).

    should have a better understanding of the threat landscape and how home user devices
    may impact the overall security that this company needs to mitigate. The answer
    comes in two simple scenarios, remote access and **Bring your Own Device** (**BYOD**).'

    exponentially. Forty-three percent of employed Americans are already working remotely
    according to Gallup (4), which means they are using their own infrastructure to
    access company's resources. Compounding this issue, we have a growth in the number
    of companies allowing BYOD in the workplace. Keep in mind that there are ways
    to implement BYOD securely, but most of the failures in the BYOD scenario usually
    happen because of poor planning and network architecture, which lead to an insecure
    implementation (5).

    To operate them, you need a user and the user is still the greatest target for
    attack. Humans are the weakest link in the security chain. For this reason, old
    threats such as phishing emails are still on the rise, because it deals with the
    psychological aspects of the user by enticing the user to click on something,
    such as a file attachment or malicious link. Usually, once the user performs one
    of these actions, their device becomes compromised by either malicious software
    (malware) or is remotely accessed by a hacker.

    for the attack is ransomware. Only during the first three months of 2016, the
    FBI reported that $209 million in ransomware payments were made (6). According
    to Trend Micro, ransomware growth will plateau in 2017; however, the attack methods

    the fact that many companies are adopting cloud computing. The vast majority will

    their main cloud service. Some other companies might opt to use **Software as

    between threat actor (or just actor), their motives and their modus operandi vary
    according to the industry. However, the report states that stolen credentials
    is the preferred attack vector for financial motivation or organized crime. This
    data is very important, because it shows that threat actors are going after user's
    credentials, which leads to the conclusion that companies must focus specifically
    on authentication and authorization of users and their access rights.

    Having a valid user account in the network will enable them to move laterally
    (pivot), and at some point find the right opportunity to escalate privilege to

    policy enforcement for accounts, which follow industry best practices such as
    strong password requirements, a policy requiring frequent password changes, and
    password strength. Another growing trend to protect user identities is to enforce
    MFA. One method that is having increased adoption is the callback feature, where
    the user initially authenticates using his/her credentials (username and password),
    and receives a call to enter their pin. If both authentication factors succeed,
    they are authorized to access the system or network. We are going to explore this

    to make sure you read the vendor's security and compliance policy (11). The intent
    here is to see if the vendor and the SaaS app are able to meet your company's
    security and compliance requirements.

    among different apps, the ones used and approved by the company and the ones used
    by the end user (personal apps). This problem becomes even more critical with
    SaaS, where users are consuming many apps that may not be secure. The traditional
    network security approach to support apps is not designed to protect data in SaaS
    apps, and worse. They don't give IT the visibility they need to know how employees
    are using them. This scenario is also called Shadow IT, and according to a survey
    conducted by **Cloud Security Alliance** (**CSA**) (12), only 8 percent of companies
    know the scope of shadow IT within their organizations. You can't protect something

    too clear for some individuals, but there are some key attributes that can help
    you identify when this type of attack is taking place. The first and most important
    attribute is that the attacker has a specific target in mind when he/she starts
    to create a plan of attack. During this initial phase, the attacker will spend
    a lot of time and resources to perform public reconnaissance to obtain the necessary
    information to carry out the attack. The motivation behind this attack is usually
    data exfiltration, in other words, stealing data. Another attribute for this type
    of attack is the longevity, or the amount of time that they maintain persistent
    access to the target's network. The intent is to continue moving laterally across
    the network, compromising different systems until the goal is reached.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    they are already inside the network. The traditional detection systems such as
    **Intrusion Detection Systems** (**IDS**) may not be sufficient to alert on suspicious
    activity taking place, especially when the traffic is encrypted. Many researchers
    already pointed out that it can take up to 229 days between the infiltration and
    detection (15). Reducing this gap is definitely one of the greatest challenges

    new level of challenge for organizations and cybersecurity professionals. In May
    2017, the world was shocked by the biggest ransomware attack in history, called
    Wannacry. This ransomware exploited a known Windows SMBv1 vulnerability that had
    a patch released in March 2017 (59 days prior to the attack) via MS17-010 (16)
    bulletin. The attackers used an exploit called EternalBlue that was released in
    April 2017, by a hacking group called Shadow Brokers. According to MalwareTech
    (18), this ransomware infected more than 400,000 machines across the globe, which
    is a gigantic number, never seen before in this type of attack. One lesson learned
    from this attack was that companies across the world are still failing to implement
    an effective vulnerability management program, which is something we will cover
    in more detail in [Chapter 15](5d0a6e90-30c4-4b7a-8f2b-2382d92d84b3.xhtml), *Vulnerability

    follows the Lockheed Martin approach, published in the paper, *Intelligence-Driven
    Computer Network Defense Informed by Analysis of Adversary Campaigns and Intrusion
    Kill Chains* (25). We will discuss the kill chain in more detail in [Chapter 3](f3d94d9a-e2b3-40cd-b625-b79bbaadcf5e.xhtml),

    highlight the details regarding how the breach occurred, provide a documented

    in order to gain access and to elevate privileges (if applicable), and the business
    impact to the company.

- en: Due to the emerging threats and cyber security challenges, it was necessary
    to change the methodology from prevent breach to assume breach. The traditional
    prevent breach approach by itself does not promote the ongoing testing, and to
    deal with modern threats you must always be refining your protection. For this
    reason, the adoption of this model to the cybersecurity field was a natural move.

    but this sentence is the core of the assume breach approach. Assume breach validates
    the protection, detection, and response to ensure they are implemented correctly.
    But to operationalize this, it becomes vital that you leverage Red/Blue Team exercises
    to simulate attacks against its own infrastructure and test the company's security
    controls, sensors, and incident-response process.

    with a more sophisticated approach. You also learned the current reality regarding
    the nationwide type of threat, and government-targeted attacks. In order to protect
    your organization against these new threats, you learned about key factors that
    can help you to enhance your security posture. It is essential that part of this
    enhancement shifts the attention from protection only to include detection and
    response. For that, the use of Red and Blue Team becomes imperative. The same
    concept applies to the assume breach methodology.
