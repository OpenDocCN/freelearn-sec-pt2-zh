                </header>

<p>The last chapter, you learned about the incident response process and how it fits into the overall enhancement of a company's security posture. Now it is time to start thinking as an attacker and understand the rationale, the motivation, and the steps of performing an attack. We call this the cybersecurity kill chain, which is something that we briefly covered in <a href="3a4a477a-d673-4f0d-bbe8-f8e2a1289d38.xhtml" target="_blank"><span class="ChapterrefPACKT">Chapter 1</span></a>, <em>Secure Posture</em>. Today, the most advanced cyber-attacks are reported to involve intrusions inside a target's network that last a long time before doing damage or being discovered. This reveals a unique characteristic of today's attackers: they have an astounding ability to remain undetected until the time is right. This means that they operate on well-structured and scheduled plans. The precision of their attacks has been under study and has revealed that most cyber attackers use a series of similar phases to pull off successful attacks.</p>
<p>To enhance your security posture, you need to ensure that all phases of the cybersecurity kill chain are covered from a protection and detection perspective. But the only way to do that is to ensure that you understand how each phase works, the mindset of an attacker, and the tolls that are taken on each phase.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we're going to be covering the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>External reconnaissance</li>
<li>Compromising the system</li>
<li>Lateral movement</li>
<li>Privilege escalation</li>
<li>Concluding the mission</li>
</ul>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>In this phase, an attacker is simply looking for a vulnerable target to attack. The motive is to harvest as much information as possible from outside the target's network and systems. This may be information about the target's supply chain, obsolete device disposal, and employee social media activities. This will enable the attacker to decide on the exploitation techniques that are suitable for each vulnerability identified about a particular target. The list of targets might be endless, but attackers have a particular taste for na√Øve users that hold certain privileges in systems. However, anyone in an organization can be targeted, including suppliers and customers. All that is needed is a weak point for the attackers to get an entrance into an organization's network.</p>
<p>There are two commonly used techniques in this stage-phishing and social engineering.</p>
<p>Phishing is done through emails where attackers send the target some carefully crafted emails to cause them to reveal secret information or open a network to attacks. It is common for attackers to attach malware to their emails that infect a target's computer after the infected attachment is opened. At other times, phishing emails will claim to be from reputable institutions, thereby inducing unsuspicious targets into divulging some sensitive information. Social engineering works in a similar fashion where attackers closely follow targets, collecting information about them which they, later on, use to get some private information. Social engineering happens mostly through social media where an attacker will follow a target through his/her various favorite social networks.</p>
<p>The attacker will find the target's likes, dislikes, and in between, their weaknesses.</p>
<p>Once either of these or another technique is used, the attacker will find a point of entrance. This might be through stolen passwords or malware infection of a computer within the target organization's network. Stolen passwords will give the attacker direct access to computers, servers, or devices within the internal network of an organization. Malware, on the other hand, can be used to infect even more computers or servers, thus bringing them under the command of the hacker.</p>

<p>In this subphase of reconaissance, an attacker will critically examine weak points identified in the reconnaissance phase. It involves the use of various scanning tools to find loopholes that can be exploited to stage an attack. Attackers take a considerable amount of time in this stage as they know that it determines a significant percentage of their success.</p>
<p>From the numerous available scanning tools, the ones presented in the sections that follow are the most commonly used ones.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">NMap</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>NMap is a free and open source network mapping tool that is available for Windows, Linux, and macOS. Network admins have appreciated the immense power that this free tool has. The tool works using raw IP packets that are sent throughout a network. This tool can do an inventory of the devices connected to a target network, identify the open ports that could be exploited, and monitor the uptime of hosts in the network.</p>
<p>This tool is also able to tell the services running on a network's hosts to fingerprint the operating systems used by the hosts and to identify the firewall rules being enforced in the network. NMap has a command-line interface, but there is a similar tool that has a graphical user interface called Zenmap. Zenmap is a tool for beginners that is simpler to use, and that comes with all the functionalities of NMap. The functionalities are, however, listed in menus, and thus, users do not have to remember commands, as is the case for NMap. Zenmap was created by the same developers of NMap just to serve the users that wished to have a GUI on their scanning tools for viewing results in a simplified way.</p>
<p>NMap works mainly through commands supplied by a user on a command-line interface. Users begin by scanning a system or network for vulnerabilities. A common way of doing this is by typing one of the following commands:</p>
<pre>    <strong>#nmap www.targetsite.com</strong>
    <strong>#nmap 255.250.123.189</strong>  </pre>
<p>For the preceding commands, the target site is the one you wish to have NMap scan. It works with either the site's URL or IP address. This basic command is mostly used in combination with other commands, such as TCP SYN Scan and Connect, UDP Scan, and FIN Scan. All of these have their equivalent command phrases. <em>Figure 1</em> shows a screenshot of the NMap scanning two IP addresses. In the screenshot, the IP addresses being scanned are <span class="packt_screen">205.217.153.62</span> and <span class="packt_screen">192.168.12.3</span>. Note how NMap shows the results for the scans, giving the open or closed ports and the services they allow to run:</p>

<p>This is a Linux-based hacking framework that has been used countless times by hackers. This is because Metasploit is made up of numerous hacking tools and frameworks that have been made to effect different types of attacks on a target. The tool has received attention from cybersecurity professionals and is today used to teach ethical hacking. The framework provides its users with vital information about multiple vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques. As well as being used by hackers, the framework is also used for penetration testing to assure organizations that they are protected from penetration techniques that attackers commonly use.</p>
<p>The Metasploit is run from a Linux terminal, which gives a command-line interface console from which exploits can be launched. The framework will tell the user the number of exploits and payloads that can be used. The user has to search for an exploit to use based on the target or what is to be scanned on a target's network. Normally, when one selects an exploit, he or she is given the payloads that can be used under that exploit.</p>
<p>The following figure shows screenshots of the Metasploit interface. This screenshot shows the exploit being set to target the host on IP address <span class="packt_screen">192.168.1.71</span>:</p>

<p>This a powerful password-cracking tool available on Linux and Windows operating systems that is used by hackers to perform dictionary attacks. The tool is used to retrieve the actual user passwords from encrypted databases of desktop or web-based systems and applications. The tool works by sampling commonly used passwords and then encrypting them with the same algorithm and key used by a given system. The tool does a comparison between its results and those that have been stored in the database to see if there are matches.</p>
<p>The tool cracks passwords in only two steps. First, it identifies the encryption type of a password. It could be RC4, SHA, or MD5, among other common encryption algorithms. It also looks at whether the encryption is salted.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Salted means that extra characters have been added to the encryption to make it more difficult to go back to the original password.</div>
<p>In the second step, the tool attempts to retrieve the original password by comparing the hashed password with many other hashes stored in its database. <em>Figure 4</em> shows a screenshot of John the Ripper recovering a password from an encrypted hash:</p>

<p>It is similar to the previously discussed tool, the only difference being that Hydra works online while John the Ripper works offline. Hydra is, however, more powerful and thus more popular among hackers. It is available for Windows, Linux, and macOSX. The tool is commonly used for fast network login hacking. It uses both dictionary and brute-force attacks to attack login pages.</p>
<p>Brute-force attacks may raise alarms on the target's side if there are some security tools put in place, and thus hackers are extremely careful with the use of the tool.</p>
<p>Hydra has been found to be effective against databases, LDAP, SMB, VNC, and SSH.</p>
<p>The workings of Hydra are quite simple. The attacker gives the tool the login page to any of the target's online systems. The tool then tries all possible combinations for the username and password fields. Hydra stores its combinations offline, making it faster to do the matching process.</p>
<p>The following diagram (<em>Figure 5</em>) shows a screenshot of the installation of Hydra. The installation is being done on a Linux machine, but the process is the same for Windows and Mac. The user is required to type make install during the installation. The setup handles the rest until completion of the installation:</p>

<p>This is a very popular tool among both hackers and pen testers. Wireshark is famous for scanning networks. The tool captures data packets in a target network and displays them in a verbose format, which is human readable. The tool allows hackers or pen testers to deeply analyze network traffic to the level of inspecting individual packets.</p>
<p>Wireshark works in two modes. The first one is the network-capturing mode. It can be left running on a victim's website for a long time while capturing all the network traffic. In the second mode, the network capturing has to be stopped in order to enable deep analysis. From here, a user of the tool can see the network traffic and start mining for insecurely exchanged passwords or to determine the different devices on the network. It is the most important functionality of the program. Wireshark has a <span class="packt_screen">Conversations</span> feature under the <span class="packt_screen">Statistics</span> menu that allows a user to view communication between computers.</p>
<p><em>Figure 6</em> shows a Wireshark interface with its separate sections and the type of information that they contain:</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Aircrack-ng is a dangerous suite of tools that is used for wireless hacking, and has become legendary in today's cyberspace. The tools are available for both Linux and Windows operating systems. It is important to note that Aircrack-ng relies on other tools to first get some information about its targets. Mostly, these programs discover the potential targets that can be hacked. Airodump-ng is the commonly used tool to do this, but other tools, such as Kismet, are reliable alternatives. Airodump-ng detects wireless access points and the clients connected to them. This information is used by Aircrack-ng to hack the access points.</p>
<p>Today, most organizations and public places have Wi-Fi, and this makes them ideal hunting grounds for hackers in possession of this suite of tools. Aircrack-ng can be used to recover the keys of secured Wi-Fi networks, provided that it captures a certain threshold of data packets in its monitoring mode. The tool is being adopted by white hats that are focused on wireless networks. The suite includes attacks such as FMS, KoreK, and PTW, which makes its capabilities incredible.</p>
<p>The FMS attack is used to attack keys that have been encrypted using RC4. KoreK is used to attack Wi-Fi networks that are secured with WEP-encrypted passwords. Lastly, PTW is used to hack through WEP- and WPA-secured Wi-Fi networks.</p>
<p>Aircrack-ng works in a number of ways. It could be used to monitor the traffic in a Wi-Fi network by capturing packets to be exported in formats that can be read by other scanning tools. It can also attack a network by creating fake access points or injecting its own packets into a network to get more information about the users and devices in a network.</p>
<p>Finally, it can recover passwords for Wi-Fi networks using the aforementioned attacks to try different combinations.</p>

<p>Nikto is a Linux-based website vulnerability scanner that hackers use to identify any exploitable loopholes in organizational websites. The tool scans the web servers for over 6,800 commonly exploited vulnerabilities. It also scans for unpatched versions of servers on over 250 platforms. The tool also checks for errors in the configurations of files in web servers. The tool is, however, not very good at masking its tracks, and thus almost always gets picked up by any intrusion detection and prevention system.</p>
<p>Nikto works through a set of command-line interface commands. Users first give it the IP address of the website that they wish to scan. The tool will do an initial scan and give back details about the web server.</p>
<p>From there, users can issue more commands to test for different vulnerabilities on the web server. <em>Figure 8</em> shows a screenshot of the Nikto tool scanning a web server for vulnerabilities. The command issued to give this output is:</p>
<pre>    <strong>Nikto -host 8.26.65.101</strong></pre>

<p>Kismet is also a wireless network sniffer and intrusion detection system. It normally sniffs through 802.11 layer 2 traffic, which includes 802.11b, 802.11a, and 802.11g. The tool works with any wireless card available on the machine that it runs on in order to sniff.</p>
<p>Unlike other tools that use a command-line interface, Kismet is operated using a graphical user interface that pops up after a user opens the program. The interface has three sections that users use to make requests or view the status of an attack. When the tool scans a Wi-Fi network, it will detect whether it is secured or unsecured. If it is secured, it detects whether the encryption used is weak. Using a number of commands, the user can instruct the tools to crack into the identified Wi-Fi networks. <em>Figure 9</em> shows a screenshot of the Kismet GUI. The graphical user interface is well laid and a user interacts with the program using well-defined menus, as shown in the screenshot:</p>

<p>Cain and Abel is a Windows-based password cracking tool that is effective against Microsoft operating systems. Hackers with this tool can simply recover the passwords for their target machines. They create a network adapter that is used to listen in to routers, and from here they can get a number of passwords from hosts sending out traffic through the affected router. The tool cracks passwords using dictionary, brute-force, and cryptanalysis. It can also record conversations that take place through VOIP, unscramble passwords, uncover cached passwords, and analyze the routing protocols of an internal network. The tool is surprisingly effective in its attacks to a point where it is choosy and ignores easily fixable bugs.</p>
<p>To use the tool, one has to turn off the Windows firewall. From there, the tool can be used to create a packet-listening adapter.</p>
<p>After this, the IP address of a router is entered. The tool will be able to listen to all packets sent to the router by hosts in the network. Passwords travelling from the hosts through the router can then be sniffed by the attacker. The following figure shows a screenshot of the interface of the Cain and Abel tool. The usernames that have <span class="packt_screen">*empty*</span> in the <span class="packt_screen">NT Password</span> field have no passwords while the rest have some password protection. The <span class="packt_screen">&lt;8</span> field displays an asterisk (<span class="packt_screen">*</span>) if the password is less than eight characters. The password can be hacked via dictionary, brute-force, and cryptanalysis attacks, as shown in the <span class="packt_screen">Context</span> menu:</p>

<p>This phase comes after an attacker has already identified a target, and scanned and exploited its vulnerabilities using the previously discussed tools and scanning tools. The main focus of the attacker in this phase is to maintain access and move around in the network while remaining undetected. In order to achieve this freedom of movement without being detected, an attacker needs to perform privilege escalation. This is an attack that will grant the attacker an elevated level of access to a network, its connected systems, and devices.</p>
<p>Privilege escalation can be done in two ways: vertical, and horizontal:</p>

            <article>
                
<p>Vertical privilege escalation is where the attacker has to grant the higher privileges to himself/herself. It is a complex procedure since the user has to perform some kernel-level operations to elevate their access rights.</p>
<p>Once the operations are done, the attacker is left with access rights and privileges that allows them to run any unauthorized code. The rights acquired using this method are those of a super user that has higher rights than an administrator.</p>
<p>Due to these privileges, an attacker can perform various harmful actions that not even an administrator can stop. In Windows, vertical escalation is used to cause buffer overflows that attackers use to execute arbitrary code. This type of privilege escalation has already been witnessed in an attack that happened in May 2017 called WannaCry. WannaCry, a ransomware, caused devastation by encrypting computers in over 150 countries in the world and demanding a ransom of $300 to decrypt that would double after the second week. The interesting thing about it is that it was using a vulnerability called EternalBlue allegedly stolen from the NSA.</p>
<p>EternalBlue allowed the malware to escalate its privileges and run any arbitrary code on Windows computers.</p>
<p>In Linux, vertical privilege escalation is used to allow attackers to run or modify programs on a target machine with root user privileges.</p>

<p>Horizontal privilege escalation, on the other hand, is simpler since it allows a user to use the same privileges gained from the initial access.</p>
<p>A good example is where an attacker has been able to steal the login credentials of an administrator of a network. The administrator account already has high privileges that the attacker assumes immediately after accessing it.</p>
<p>Horizontal privilege also occurs when an attacker is able to access protected resources using a normal user account. A good example is where a normal user is erroneously able to access the account of another user. This is normally done through session and cookie theft, cross-site scripting, guessing weak passwords, and logging keystrokes.</p>
<p>At the end of this phase, the attacker normally has well-established remote access entry points into a target system. The attacker might also have access to the accounts of several users. The attacker also knows how to avoid detection from security tools that the target might have. This leads to the next phase, called exfiltration.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>This is the phase where the main attack starts. Once an attack has reached this phase, it is considered successful. The attacker normally has unobstructed freedom to move around a victim's network and access all its systems and sensitive data. The attacker will start extracting sensitive data from an organization. This could include trade secrets, usernames, passwords, personally identifiable data, top-secret documents, and other types of data. Attackers normally steal huge chunks of data in this stage. This data can either be sold off to willing buyers or leaked to the public. There have been some ugly incidents facing big companies whose data has been stolen.</p>
<p>In 2015, a hacker group breached and stole 9.7 GB of data from a site called Ashley Madison, which offered spouse-cheating services. The hackers told Avid Life Media, the company that owned the website, to take it down or they would release some user data. The mother company rubbished the claims, but the hackers soon dumped the data on the dark web. The data included real names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and login credentials of millions of users. The hackers encouraged the people affected by the leak to sue the company and claim damages.</p>
<p>In 2016, Yahoo came out and said that data belonging to over a billion user accounts had been stolen by hackers back in 2013. The company said that this was a separate incident from the one where user data of half a million accounts had been stolen by hackers in 2014. Yahoo said that in the 2013 incident, hackers were able to exfiltrate names, email addresses, dates of birth, and security questions and answers, as well as hashed passwords.</p>
<p>The hackers allegedly used forged cookies that allowed them to gain access to the company's systems without a password. In 2016, LinkedIn, was hacked and the user data of over 160 million accounts was stolen.</p>
<p>The hackers soon put the data on sale for any interested buyers. The data was said to contain the email and encrypted passwords of the accounts. These three incidents show how serious an attack becomes after the attacker is able to get to this stage. The victim organizations' reputations suffer, and they have to pay huge sums of money as fines for not securing user data.</p>
<p>The attackers at times do more than just exfiltration of the data. They could erase or modify the files stored in the compromised computers, systems, and servers. In March 2017, hackers demanded ransom from Apple and threatened to wipe the data belonging to 300 million iPhones on iCloud accounts. Although this was soon rubbished as a scam, it shows that it is possible. In this case, a big company such as Apple was put in the spotlight when the hackers tried to extort money from it. It is possible that another company would hurriedly pay the hackers in order to prevent the data of its users from being wiped out.</p>
<p>All of these incidents that faced Apple, Ashley Madison, LinkedIn and Yahoo show the significance of this stage. Hackers that manage to reach this stage are virtually in control. The victim might still not be in the know that data has already been stolen. The hackers may decide to remain silent for a while. When this happens, the attack enters a new phase called sustainment.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>Sustainment happens when the attackers are already freely roaming in the network and copying all data that they think is valuable. They enter this stage when they want to remain undetected. There is an option to end the attack in the previous stage when data has already been stolen and can either be publicized or sold. Highly motivated attackers that want to completely finish off a target choose to continue with the attack, though. Attackers install malware, such as rootkit viruses, that assure them of access to the victim's computers and systems whenever they want.</p>
<p>The main aim of entering this stage is to buy time to perform another and even more harmful attack than exfiltration. The attacker is motivated to move past data and software and attack the hardware of an organization. The victim's security tools are at this point ineffective at either detecting or stopping the attack from proceeding. The attacker normally has multiple access points to the victims, such that even if one access point is closed, their access is not compromised.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>Assault is the most feared stage of any cyber-attack. It is where the attacker does damage exceeding the data and software. An attacker might disable or alter the functioning of the victim's hardware permanently. The attacker focuses on destroying hardware controlled by the compromised systems and computing devices.</p>
<p>A good example of an attack that got to this phase is the Stuxnet attack on Iran's nuclear station. It was the first recorded digital weapon to be used to wreak havoc on physical resources. Just like any other attack, Stuxnet had followed the previously explained phases and had been residing in the facility's network for a year. Initially, Stuxnet is used to manipulate valves in the nuclear facility, causing the pressure to build up and damage a few devices in the plant. The malware was then modified to attack a larger target, the centrifuges. This was achieved in three stages.</p>
<p>The malware was transmitted to the target computers through USB thumb drives, since they were not connected to the internet. Once it infected one of the target computers, the malware replicated itself and spread to the other computers. The malware proceeded to the next stage where it infected some software by Siemens called Step7 that was used to control the programming of logic controllers. Once this software was compromised, the malware finally gained access to the program logic controllers. This allowed the attackers to directly operate various machinery in the nuclear plant. The attackers caused the fast-spinning centrifuges to spin out of control and tear apart on their own.</p>
<p>The Stuxnet malware shows the heights that this phase can reach. The Iranian nuclear facility stood no chance of protecting itself as the attackers had already gained access, escalated their privileges, and stayed out of sight from security tools. The plant operators said that they were receiving many identical errors on the computers, but all virus scans showed that they had not been infected. It is clear that the attackers did a few test runs of the worm within the compromised facility with the valves. They found out that it was effective, and decided to scale up to attack the centrifuges and crash Iran's nuclear weaponry prospects.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Obfuscation</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>This is the last stage of the attack which some attackers may choose to ignore. The main aim here is for the attackers to cover their tracks for various reasons. If the attackers do not want to be known, they use various techniques to confuse, deter, or divert the forensic investigation process that follows a cyber-attack. Some attackers may, however, opt to leave their trails unmasked if they operated anonymously or want to boast of their exploits.</p>
<p>Obfuscation is done in a number of ways. One of the ways that attackers prevent their adversaries from catching up with them is by obfuscating their origins. There are a number of ways through which this can be achieved. Hackers at times attack outdated servers in small businesses and then laterally move to attack other servers or targets. Therefore, the origins of the attacks will be tracked down to the servers of the innocent small business that does not regularly perform updates.</p>
<p>This type of obfuscation was recently witnessed in a university where the IoT lights were hacked into and used to attack the university's servers. When forensic analysts came to investigate the DDoS attack on the servers, they were surprised to see that it originated from the university's 5,000 IoT lights.</p>
<p>Another origin obfuscation technique is the use of public school servers. Hackers have repeatedly used this technique where they hack into vulnerable web applications of public schools and move laterally into the schools' networks, installing backdoors and rootkit viruses to the servers. These servers are then used to launch attacks on bigger targets since forensic investigations will identify the public schools as the origin.</p>
<p>Lastly, social clubs are also used to mask the origins of attacks by hackers. Social clubs offer their members free Wi-Fi, but it is not always highly protected. This provides hackers with an ideal ground for infecting devices that they can later use to execute attacks without the knowledge of the owners.</p>
<p>Another obfuscation technique that hackers commonly use is the stripping out of metadata. Metadata can be used by law enforcement agencies to catch up with perpetrators of some crimes.</p>
<p>In 2012, a hacker by the name Ochoa was charged for hacking the FBI database and releasing the private details of police officers.</p>
<p>Ochoa, who used the name "wormer" in his hacks, was caught after he forgot to strip metadata from a picture that he placed on the FBI site after hacking it. The metadata showed the FBI the exact location of the place where the photo was taken and this led to his arrest. Hackers have learned from that incident that it is irresponsible to leave any metadata in their hacking activities as it could be their downfall, just as it was for Ochoa.</p>
<p>It is also common for hackers to cover their trails using dynamic code obfuscation. This involves the generation of different malicious codes to attack targets, but prevents detection from signature-based antivirus and firewall programs.</p>
<p>The pieces of code can be generated using randomizing functions or by changing some function parameters. Therefore, hackers make it significantly harder for any signature-based security tool to protect systems against their malicious codes. This also makes it difficult for forensic investigators to identify the attacker as most of the hacking is done by random code.</p>
<p>At times, hackers will use dynamic code generators to add meaningless codes to their original code. This makes a hack appear very sophisticated to investigators, and it slows down their progress in analyzing the malicious code. A few lines of code could be made to be thousands or millions of meaningless lines. This might discourage forensic investigators from analyzing code deeper to identify some unique elements or hunt for any leads towards the original coder.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Threat life cycle management</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>An investment in threat life cycle management can enable an organization to stop attacks just as they happen. It is a worthy investment for any company today since statistics show that the cyber breaches being witnessed are not slowing down. There was a 760% increase in cyber-attacks from 2014 to 2016. Cybercrimes are increasing because of three things. To begin with, there are more motivated threat actors. Cybercrime has become a low-risk, high-return business for some people. Despite the increase in the number of breaches, there has been a very low conviction rate, which shows that very few cyber criminals get caught.</p>
<p>At the same time, organizations are losing billions to these motivated attackers. Another reason for the increase in the number of breaches is the maturity of the cybercrime economy and supply chain. Cyber criminals are today able to access numerous exploits and malware that are for sale, provided that they can pay commensurate amounts of money. Cybercrime has become a business that has sufficient suppliers and willing buyers. The buyers are multiplying with the advent of hacktivism and cyberterrorism. This is, therefore, leading to an unprecedented increase in the number of breaches.</p>
<p>Lastly, breaches are on the rise because of the expansion of attack surfaces by organizations. New technologies have been adopted, bringing new vulnerabilities and therefore widening the surface area that cybercriminals can attack.</p>
<p>The <strong>Internet of Things</strong> (<strong>IoT</strong>), one of the latest additions to organizational technologies, has already caused a number of companies to be hacked. The future is dull if organizations do not take the required precautions to protect themselves.</p>
<p>The best investment that they can make now is in threat life cycle management to allow them to respond appropriately to attacks based on the phase that they are in. In 2015, an investigation report by Verizon claimed that, out of all attacks, 84% left evidence in the log data. This means that with the appropriate tools and mindset, these attacks could have been mitigated early enough to prevent any damage. There are six phases to threat life cycle management.</p>
<p>The first phase is forensic data collection. Prior to the detection of a full blown threat, some evidence is observable in the IT environment. Threats can come through any of the seven domains of IT. Therefore, the more of the IT infrastructure the organization can see, the more threats it can detect.</p>
<p>There are three applicable things at this phase. To start off, organizations should collect security event and alarm data. Today, organizations use countless security tools to help them nab attackers and prevent their attacks from being successful. Some of these tools only give warnings and, therefore, simply generate events and alarms. Some powerful tools may not sound alarms for small-level detections, but they will generate security events. However, tens of thousands of events may be generated daily, thus confusing an organization on which ones to focus on. Another applicable thing in this phase is the collection of log and machine data. This type of data can provide a deeper visibility of what actually goes on in an organizational network on a per-user or per-application basis. The last applicable thing in this stage is the collection of forensic sensor data. Forensic sensors, such as network and endpoint forensic sensors, are even more in depth, and they come in handy when logs are not available.</p>
<p>The next phase in threat life cycle management is the discovery phase. This comes after the organization has established visibility and thus can detect attacks early enough. This phase can be achieved in two ways.</p>
<p>The first of these is search analytics. This is where IT employees in the organization carry out software-aided analytics. They are able to review reports and identify any known or reported exceptions from network and antivirus security tools. This process is labor intensive and therefore should not be the sole analytics method that a whole organization should rely on.</p>
<p>The second way of achieving this phase is by using machine analytics. This is analytics that is purely done by machines/software. The software normally has machine learning capabilities and, therefore, artificial intelligence, enabling them to autonomously scan large amounts of data and give brief and simplified results to people to further analyze. It is estimated that over a quarter of all security tools will have machine learning capabilities by the beginning of 2018. Machine learning simplifies the threat discovery process since it is automated and continually learns new threats on its own.</p>
<p>Next is the qualification phase, where the threats discovered in the previous phase are assessed to find out their potential impact, urgency of resolution, and how they can be mitigated. The phase is time sensitive, as an identified attack may mature faster than expected.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, it is not simple, and consumes a lot of manual labor and time. In this phase, false positives are a big challenge, and they must be identified to prevent the organization from using resources against nonexistent threats. Inefficient qualification may lead to true positives being missed and false positives being included. Legitimate threats could, therefore, go unnoticed and unattended. As you can see, this is, a sensitive phase in the threat management process.</p>
<p>The next phase is the investigation phase where threats categorized as true positives are fully investigated to determine whether or not they have caused a security incident.</p>
<p>This phase requires continuous access to forensic data and intelligence about very many threats. It is mostly automated, and this simplifies the lookup process for a threat among millions of known threats. This phase also looks at any potential damage a threat might have done in the organization before it was identified by the security tools. Based on information gathered from this phase, the IT team of an organization can proceed accordingly against a threat.</p>
<p>Next comes the neutralization phase. Here, mitigations are applied to eliminate or reduce the impact of an identified threat to an organization. Organizations strive to get to this stage as quickly as possible since threats involving ransomware or privileged user accounts might do irreversible damage in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Therefore, every second counts when eliminating identified threats. This process is also automated to ensure a higher throughput of deleting threats, and to also ease information sharing and collaboration between several departments in an organization.</p>
<p>The last phase is recovery, which only comes after an organization is sure that its identified threats have been neutralized and that any risks that it faced are put under control. The aim of this phase is to restore the organization to a position it enjoyed prior to being attacked by threats. Recovery is less time critical, and it highly depends on the type of software or service being made available again. This process, however, requires care to be taken; changes that might have been made during an attack incident or during the response need to be backtracked. These two processes may cause undesired configurations or actions to have been taken to either compromise a system or prevent it from sustaining further damage. It is essential that systems are brought back to the exact state that they were in before being attacked. There are automated recovery tools that can return systems automatically to a backed-up state. Due diligence must, however, be carried out to ensure that no backdoors are introduced or are left behind.</p>

<p>This chapter gave an overall picture of the phases commonly involved in cyber-attacks. It exposed the mindset of an attacker. It showed how an attacker gets details about a target using simple methods and advanced intrusion tools to later on use this information to attack users. It has discussed the two main ways through which attackers escalate their privileges when they attack systems. It has explained how cyberattackers exfiltrate data from systems that they have access to. It has also looked at scenarios where attackers proceed to attack the hardware of a victim to cause more damage. It has then discussed ways through which attackers maintain anonymity. Lastly, the chapter has highlighted ways through which users can interrupt the threat life cycle and thwart attacks.</p>
<p>The next chapter will take an in-depth look at reconnaissance to fully understand how attackers collect information about users and systems using social media, compromised websites, emails, and scanning tools.</p>
