<p>The previous chapter gave you an overall view of all the stages of the cyber-attack life cycle. This chapter will go into the first phase of the life cycle in depth—reconnaissance. Reconnaissance is one of the most important stages of a threat life cycle, where attackers search for vulnerabilities that they can use to attack targets. An attacker will be interested in locating and gathering data, and identifying any loopholes in a target's network, its users, or its computing systems. Reconnaissance is done both passively and actively, borrowing tactics that have been used by the military. It can be compared to the sending of spies into an enemy's territory to gather data about where and when to strike. When reconnaissance is done in the right way, the target should not be able to know that it is being done. This critical attack life cycle phase can be actualized in a number of ways, which are broadly classified as external and internal reconnaissance.</p>
<p>This chapter is going to discuss the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>External reconnaissance:
<ul>
<li>Dumpster diving</li>
<li>The use of social media to obtain information about the target</li>
<li>Social engineering</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tools used to perform internal reconnaissance</li>
</ul>

<p>External reconnaissance is done outside of the organization's network and systems. It is normally targeted by exploiting the carelessness of users of an organization. There are several ways in which this can be done.</p>

<p>Organizations dispose of obsolete devices in a number of ways, such as through bidding, sending to recyclers, or dumping them in storage. There are serious implications for these methods of disposal. Google is one of the companies that are thorough in the way they dispose of devices that may have contained user data. The company destroys its old hard drives from its data centers to prevent the data that they contained from being accessed by malicious people. The hard drives are put into a crusher that pushes steel pistons up the center of the disks, rendering them unreadable. This process continues until the machine spits out tiny pieces of the hard drive, which are then sent to a recycling center. This is a rigorous and fail-proof exercise. Some other companies are not able to do this and therefore opt to delete the data contained in old hard disks by using military-grade deletion software. This ensures that data cannot be recovered from old hard drives when they are disposed of.</p>
<p>However, most organizations are not thorough enough when handling old external storage devices or obsolete computers. Some do not even bother to delete the contained data. Since these obsolete devices may be disposed of by sometimes careless means, attackers are able to easily obtain them from their points of disposal. The obsolete storage devices may give attackers a lot of information about the internal setup of an organization. It may also allow them to access openly-stored passwords on browsers, find out the privileges and details of different users, and may even give them access to some bespoke systems used in the network.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Social media</h1>

<p>Social media has opened up another hunting ground for hackers. The easiest way to find out a lot of information about people today is by going through their social media accounts. Hackers have found social media to be the best place to mine data concerning specific targets, as people are likely to share information on such platforms. Of particular importance today is data related to the companies users work for. Other key pieces of information that can be obtained from social media accounts include details about family members, relatives, friends, and residence and contact information. As well as this, attackers have learned a new way of using social media to execute even more nefarious pre-attacks.</p>
<p>A recent incident involving a Russian hacker and a Pentagon official showed how sophisticated hackers have become. The Pentagon official is said to have clicked on a post put up by a robot account about a holiday package. This is because Pentagon officials had been trained by cyber security experts to avoid clicking or opening attachments sent by mail. The official had clicked on a link that is said to have compromised his computer. Cyber security experts classified this as a spear phishing threat; however, instead of using emails, it used a social media post. Hackers are looking for this type of unpredictable, and sometimes unnoticeable, pre-attack. The attacker is said to have been able to access a wealth of sensitive information about the official through this attack.</p>
<p>Another way that hackers exploit social media users is by going through their account posts to obtain information that can be used in passwords or as answers to secret questions used to reset some accounts. This is information such as a user's date of birth, their parent's maiden name, names of the street that they grew up in, pet names, school names, and other types of random information. Users are known to use weak passwords due to laziness or lack of knowledge about the threats that they face. It is, therefore, possible that some users use their birth dates as their work email passwords. Work emails are easy to guess since they use a person's official name and end in an organization's domain name. Armed with their official name from their social media accounts, as well as viable passwords, an attacker is able to plan how to get into a network and perform an attack.</p>
<p>Another danger looming in social media is identity theft. It is surprisingly easy to create a fake account bearing the identity of another person. All that is needed is access to some pictures and up-to-date details of the identity theft victim. This is all in the playbook of hackers. They track information about organizations' users and their bosses. They can then create accounts with the names and details of the bosses. This will allow them to get favors or issue orders to oblivious users, even through the likes of social media. A confident hacker could even request network information and statistics from the IT department using the identity of a high-ranking employee. The hacker will continue to get information about the network's security, which will then enable him to find a way to hack into it successfully in the near future.</p>

<p>This is one of the most feared reconnaissance acts due to the nature of the target. A company can shield itself from many types of attack with security tools, but it cannot completely protect itself from this type of threat. Social engineering has been perfectly developed to exploit human nature—something beyond the protection of security tools. Hackers are aware that there exist very strong and powerful tools to prevent them from getting any type of information from organizational networks. Scanning and spoofing tools are easily identified by intrusion detection devices and firewalls. Therefore, it is somewhat difficult to beat today's level of security with the usual threats since their signatures are known and can easily be thwarted. The human component, on the other hand, is still open to attacks through manipulation. Humans are sympathetic, trusting of friends, show-offs, and obedient to higher authorities; they are easy to convince provided that one can bring them around to a certain way of thinking.</p>
<p>There are six levers that social engineers use to get victims to talk. One of these is reciprocation, where a victim does something for a social media user who in turn feels the need to reciprocate the favor. It is part of human nature to feel obligated to return a favor to a person, and attackers have come to know and exploit this. Another lever is scarcity, where a social engineer will get compliance from a target by threatening a short supply of something that the target is in need of. It could be a trip, a mega sale, or a new release of products. A lot of work is done to find out a target's likes in order to enable social engineers to pull this lever. The next lever is consistency, whereby humans tend to honor promises or get used to the usual flow of events. When an organization always orders and receives IT consumables from a certain vendor, it is very easy for attackers to clone the vendor and deliver malware-infected electronics.</p>
<p>Another lever is liking, whereby humans are more likely to comply with the requests of people they like or those that appear attractive. Social engineers are experts at making themselves sound and appear attractive to easily win the compliance of targets. A commonly used lever that has a high success rate is authority. Generally, humans are obedient to the authority of those that are ranked above them; they can therefore easily bend the rules for them and grant their wishes even if they seem malicious. Many users will give their login credentials if a high-ranking IT employee requests them. In addition, many users will not think twice if their manager or director asks them to send some sensitive data over unsecured channels. It is easy to use this lever and many people can easily fall victim. The last lever is social validation: humans will readily comply and do something if other people are doing the same, as they do not want to appear the odd one out. All a hacker needs to do is make something appear normal and then request an unsuspicious user to do the same.</p>
<p>All the social engineering levers can be used in different types of social engineering attacks. The following are some popular types of social engineering attacks.</p>

<p>This is a method of indirectly putting pressure on targets to get them to divulge some information or perform unusual actions. It involves the construction of an elaborate lie that has been well-researched so as to appear legitimate to the target. This technique has been able to get accountants to release huge amounts of money to imaginary bosses who issue an order for payment into a certain account. It is therefore very easy for a hacker to use this technique to steal login credentials of users, or to get access to some sensitive files. Pretexting can be used to mediate an even bigger social engineering attack that will use the legitimate information to construe another lie. Social engineers that use pretexting have honed the art of impersonating other trusted individuals in society, such as police officers, debt collectors, tax officials, clergy, or investigators.</p>

<p>This is a con game, whereby attackers persuade delivery and transport companies that their deliveries and services are requested elsewhere. There are some advantages of getting the consignments of a certain company—the attackers can physically dress as the legitimate delivery agent and proceed to deliver already-flawed products. They might have installed rootkits or some spying hardware that will go undetected in the delivered products.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Phishing</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>This is one of the oldest tricks that hackers have used over the years, but its success rate is still surprisingly high. Phishing is mainly a technique that is used to obtain sensitive information about a company or a specific person in a fraudulent way. The normal execution of this attack involves a hacker sending emails to a target, pretending to be a legitimate third-party organization requesting information for verification purposes. The attacker normally attaches dire consequences to the lack of provision of the requested information. A link leading to a malicious or fraudulent website is also attached and the users are advised to use it to access a certain legitimate website. The attackers will have made a replica website, complete with logos and usual content, as well as a form to fill in with sensitive information. The idea is to capture the details of a target that will enable the attacker to commit a bigger crime. Targeted information includes login credentials, social security numbers, and bank details. Attackers are still using this technique to capture sensitive information from users of a certain company so that they can use it to access its networks and systems in future attacks.</p>
<p>Some terrible attacks have been carried out through phishing. Some time back, hackers were sending phishing emails claiming to be from a certain court and ordering the recipients to appear before the court at a certain date. The email came with a link that enabled recipients to view more details about the court notice. However, upon clicking the link, the recipients installed malware on their computers that was used for other malicious purposes, such as key logging and the collection of stored login credentials in browsers.</p>
<p>Another famous phishing attack was the IRS refund. Cyber attackers took advantage of the month of April, when many people were anxiously waiting for possible refunds from the IRS, and sent emails claiming to be from the IRS, attaching ransomware through a Word file. When recipients opened the Word document, the ransomware would encrypt the user's files in the hard disk and any connected external storage device.</p>
<p>A more sophisticated phishing attack was used against multiple targets through a famous job board company called CareerBuilder. Here, hackers pretended to be normal job applicants, but instead of attaching resumes they uploaded malicious files. CareerBuilder then forwarded these CVs to multiple companies that were hiring. It was the ultimate hack, which saw malware transferred to many organizations. There have also been multiple police departments that have fallen prey to ransomware. In New Hampshire, a police officer clicked on an email that appeared legitimate and the computer that he was using was infected with ransomware. This has happened to many other police departments across the world, which shows the amount of power that phishing still has.</p>
<p>The following figure shows an example of a phishing email sent to a Yahoo user:</p>

<p>This is a unique type of phishing where the attacker uses phone calls instead of emails. It is an advanced level of a phishing attack whereby the attacker will use an illegitimate interactive voice response system that sounds exactly like the ones used by banks, service providers, and so on. This attack is mostly used as an extension of the email phishing attack to make a target reveal secret information. A toll-free number is normally provided, which when called leads the target to the rogue interactive voice response system. The target will be prompted by the system to give out some verification information. It is normal for the system to reject input that a target gives so as to ensure that several PINs are disclosed. This is enough for the attackers to proceed and steal money from a target, be it a person or an organization. In extreme cases, a target will be forwarded to a fake customer care agent to assist with failed login attempts. The fake agent will continue questioning the target, gaining even more sensitive information.</p>
<p>The following diagram shows a scenario in which a hacker uses phishing to obtain the login credentials of a user:</p>

            <article>
                
<p>This is also related to a normal phishing attack, but it does not send out high volumes of emails in a random manner. Spear phishing is specifically targeted to obtain information from particular end users in an organization. Spear phishing is more strenuous since it requires the attackers to perform a number of background checks on targets in order to identify a victim that they can pursue. Attackers will then carefully craft an email that addresses something of interest to the target, coercing him or her to open it. Statistically, normal phishing has a 3% success rate, whereas spear phishing has a 70% success rate. It is also said that only 5% of people who open phishing emails click links or download any attachments, while almost half of all people who open spear phishing emails click on their links and download attachments.</p>
<p>A good example of a spear phishing attack would be one whereby attackers are targeting a staff member in the HR department. These are employees that have to be in constant contact with the world when seeking new talent. A spear phisher might craft an email accusing the department of corruption or nepotism, providing a link to a website where disgruntled—and fictional—potential employees have been complaining. HR staff members are not necessarily very knowledgeable about IT-related issues, and therefore might easily click on such links, and as a result get infected. From one single infection, malware can easily spread inside an organization by making its way through to the HR server, which almost every organization has.</p>

<p>This is a social engineering attack that takes advantage of the amount of trust that users give to websites they regularly visit, such as interactive chat forums and exchange boards. Users on these websites are more likely to act in abnormally careless manners. Even the most careful people, who avoid clicking links in emails, will not hesitate to click on links provided on these types of website. These websites are referred to as watering holes because hackers trap their victims there just as predators wait to catch their prey at watering holes. Here, hackers exploit any vulnerabilities on the website, attack them, take charge, and then inject code that infects visitors with malware or that leads clicks to malicious pages. Due to the nature of the planning done by the attackers that choose this method, these attacks are normally tailored to a specific target and specific devices, operating systems, or applications that they use. It is used against some of the most IT-knowledgeable people, such as system administrators. An example of water holing is the exploitation of vulnerabilities in a site such as <span class="URLPACKT">StackOverflow.com</span>, which is often frequented by IT personnel. If the site is bugged, a hacker could inject malware into the computers of the visiting IT staff.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>This preys upon the greed or curiosity of a certain target. It is one of the simplest social engineering techniques since all that it involves is an external storage device (1). An attacker will leave a malware-infected external storage device in a place where other people can easily find it. It could be in the washroom of an organization, in the elevator, at the reception desk, on the pavement, or even in the parking lot. Greedy or curious users in an organization will then retrieve the object and hurriedly plug it into their machines. Attackers are normally crafty and will leave files in the flash drive that a victim will be tempted to open. For example, a file labeled "the executive summary of salaries and upcoming promotions" is likely to get the attention of many.</p>
<p>If this does not work, an attacker might replicate the design of corporate thumb drives and then drop a few around the organization where they can be picked up by some of its staff. Eventually, they will end up being plugged into a computer and files will be opened. Attackers will have planted malware to infect the computers the flash drive is plugged into. Computers configured to auto-run devices once plugged in are in greater danger, since no user action is required to initiate the malware infection process.</p>
<p>In more serious cases, attackers might install rootkit viruses in the thumb drive that infect computers when they boot, while an infected secondary storage media is then connected to them. This will give attackers a higher level of access to the computer and the ability to move undetected. Baiting has a high success rate because it is human nature to either be greedy or curious and open and read files that are above their level of access. This is why attackers will choose to label storage media or files with tempting titles such as "confidential" or "executive" since internal employees are always interested in such things.</p>

<p>This is a common social engineering attack that is commonly carried out by low-level attackers. These attackers do not have any advanced tools at their disposal and do not do research about the targets. These attackers will keep calling random numbers claiming to be from technical support, and will offer some sort of assistance. Once in a while, they find people with legitimate technical problems and will then "help" them to solve those problems. They guide them through the necessary steps, which then gives the attackers access to the victims' computers or the ability to launch malware. This is a tedious method that has a very low success rate.</p>

<p>This is the least common social engineering attack and is not as technically advanced as the ones we've discussed previously. However, it does have a significant success rate. Attackers use this method to gain entry into restricted premises or parts of buildings. Most organizational premises have electronic access control and users normally require biometric or RFID cards to be allowed in. An attacker will walk behind an employee that has legitimate access and enter behind them. At times, the attacker may ask an employee to borrow their RFID card, or may gain entry by using a fake card under the guise of accessibility problems.</p>

<p>Unlike external reconnaissance attacks, internal reconnaissance is done on-site. This means that the attacks are carried out within an organization's network, systems, and premises. Mostly, this process is aided by software tools. An attacker interacts with the actual target systems in order to find out information about its vulnerabilities. This is the main difference between internal and external reconnaissance techniques.</p>
<p>External reconnaissance is done without interacting with the system, but by instead finding entry points through humans that work in the organization. That is why most external reconnaissance attempts involve hackers trying to reach users through social media, emails, and phone calls. Internal reconnaissance is still a passive attack since the aim is to find information that can be used in future for an even more serious attack.</p>
<p>The main target of internal reconnaissance is the internal network of an organization, where hackers are sure to find the data servers and the IP addresses of hosts they can infect. It is known that data in a network can be read by anyone in the same network with the right tools and skill set. Attackers use networks to discover and analyze potential targets to attack in the future. Internal reconnaissance is used to determine the security mechanisms in place that ward off hacking attempts. There are many cyber security tools that have been made to mitigate software used to perform reconnaissance attacks. However, most organizations never install enough security tools and hackers keep on finding ways to hack through the already-installed ones. There are a number of tools that hackers have tested and have found to be effective at studying their targets<span>'</span> networks. Most of them can be classified as sniffing tools.</p>

<p>These are terms used in networking that generally refer to the act of eavesdropping on traffic in a network. They enable both attackers and defenders to know exactly what is happening in a network. Sniffing tools are designed to capture the packets being transmitted over a network and to perform analysis on them, which is then presented in a human-readable format. In order to perform internal reconnaissance, packet analysis is more than essential. It gives attackers a lot of information about the network to a level where it can be compared to reading the logical layout of the network  on paper.</p>
<p>Some sniffing tools go to the extent of revealing confidential information, such as passwords from WEP-protected Wi-Fi networks. Other tools enable users to set them up to capture traffic over a long period of time on wired and wireless networks, after which the users can analyze at their own convenience. There are a number of sniffing tools available today that hackers commonly use.</p>

<p>Designed only for Linux, this tool allows hackers to sniff with Prism2 chipset-based cards. This technology is only meant to capture packets, and therefore leaves analysis to be performed by other tools; this is the reason why it dumps the captured packets in a <kbd>pcap</kbd> format, which is widely used by other sniffing tools. Most open source sniffing tools use <kbd>pcap</kbd> as the standard packet capture format. Since this tool is only specialized to capture data, it is reliable and can be used for long reconnaissance missions. The following diagram is a screenshot of the <kbd>prismdump</kbd> tool:</p>

<p>This is an open-source sniffing tool that is used for packet capture and analysis. <kbd>tcpdump</kbd> runs using a command line interface. <kbd>tcpdump</kbd> has also been custom-designed for packet capturing as it does not have a GUI that enables the analysis and display of data. It is a tool with one of the most powerful packet-filtering capabilities and can even selectively capture packets. This differentiates it from most other sniffing tools that have no means of filtering packets during capture. Following is a screenshot of the <kbd>tcpdump</kbd> tool. In the screenshot, it is listening to the <kbd>ping</kbd> commands being sent to its host:</p>

<p>This is an open source network sniffing tool that is commonly used to map networks. The tool records IP packets entering and leaving a network. It also maps out fine details about a network, such as the devices connected to it and also any open and closed ports. The tool can go as far as identifying the operating systems of the devices that are connected to the network, as well as the configurations of firewalls. It uses a simple text-based interface, but there is an advanced version of it called Zenmap that also has a GUI. Following is a screenshot of the <span class="packt_screen">nmap</span> interface. The command being executed is:</p>
<pre><strong>#nmap 192.168.12.3</strong> </pre>
<p>This command is executed to scan the ports of the computer on the IP address <kbd>192.168.12.3</kbd>:</p>

<p>This is one of the most revered tools used for network scanning and sniffing. The tool is so powerful that it can steal authentication details from the traffic sent out of a network (1). This is surprisingly easy to do, such that one can effortlessly become a hacker by merely following a few steps. On Linux, Windows, and Mac, you need to make sure that a device, preferably a laptop, installed with Wireshark is connected to a network. Wireshark needs to be started so that it can capture packets. After a given period of time, one can stop Wireshark and proceed to perform the analysis. To get passwords, one needs to filter the data captured to show only the POST data. This is because most websites use the POST to transfer authentication information to their servers. It will list all the POST data actions that were made. One will then right-click on any of these and select the option to follow the TCP stream. Wireshark will open a window showing a username and password. At times, the captured password is hashed, and this is common with websites. One can easily crack the hash value and recover the original password using other tools.</p>
<p>Wireshark can also be used for other functions, such as recovering Wi-Fi passwords. Since it is open source, the community continually updates its capabilities and therefore will continue to add new features. Its current basic features include capturing packets, importing <kbd>pcap</kbd> files, displaying protocol information about packets, exporting captured packets in multiple formats, colorizing packets based on filters, giving statistics about a network, and the ability to search through captured packets. The file has advanced capabilities, and these make it ideal for hacking. The open source community, however, uses it for white hacking, which discovers vulnerabilities in networks before black hats do.</p>
<p>Following is a screenshot of Wireshark capturing network packets:</p>

<p>This is a scanning tool that has been specifically made to be extremely quick but effective. It tops most other scanning tools with its fast speeds, which it achieves in two ways. The tool contains a process that sends multiple queries at once and another process that receives the responses and integrates them. The two processes do not consult and therefore the receiving process never knows what to expect—just that there will be response packets. There is, however, a clever hash-based way that is integrated into the tool that allows you to see the valid responses that it receives from scanning. The tool is totally different from old scanning tools such as NMap, and its advancements enable it to be quicker and more effective at capturing packets.</p>

<p>This is one of the most effective tools for cracking passwords made specifically for the Windows platform. The tool recovers passwords by cracking them using dictionary, brute force, and cryptanalysis attacks. It also sniffs from the network by listening in to voice-over IP conversations and uncovering cached passwords. The tool has been optimized to work only with Microsoft operating systems. Following is a screenshot of the Cain and Abel tool:</p>

<p>This is a free scanning tool made and distributed by Tenable Network Security. It is among the best network scanners and has bagged several awards for being the best vulnerability scanner for white hats. Nessus has several functionalities that may come in handy for an attacker doing internal reconnaissance. The tool can scan a network and show connected devices that have misconfigurations and missing patches. The tool also shows the devices that are using their default passwords, weak passwords, or have no passwords at all.</p>
<p>The tool can recover passwords from some devices by launching an external tool to help it with dictionary attacks against targets in the network. Lastly, the tool is able to show abnormal traffic in the network, which can be used to monitor DDoS attacks. Nessus has the ability to call to external tools to help it achieve extra functionality. When it begins scanning a network, it can call to NMap to help it scan for open ports and will automatically integrate the data that NMap collects. Nessus is then able to use this type of data to continue scanning and finding out more information about a network using commands scripted in its own language. The following diagram shows a screenshot of Nessus displaying a scan report:</p>

<p>This is a legendary framework made up of a number of tools that are used for scanning and exploiting networks. Due to the far-reaching capabilities of this tool, most white hat trainers use it to pass knowledge to their students. It is also a penetration tester that is the software of choice in a number of organizations. So far, the framework has over 1,500 exploits that can be used against browsers, Android, Microsoft, Linux and Solaris operating systems, and varied other exploits applicable to any platform. The tool deploys its payloads using a command shell, the meterpreter, or dynamic payloads.</p>
<p>The advantage of Metasploit is that it has mechanisms that detect and evade security programs that can be present inside a network. The framework has several commands that can be used to sniff information from networks. It also has complementary tools that can be used for exploitation after information about vulnerabilities in a network has been collected.</p>
<p>Following are screenshots of Metasploit:</p>

<p>Another tool for scanning wireless networks is Aircrack-ng. This is specifically used to crack the passwords of secured wireless networks. The tool is advanced and has algorithms that can crack WEP, WPA, and WPA2 secured wireless networks (1). It has simple commands and even a newbie can easily crack a WEP secured network. The potential of the tool comes from its combination of FMS, Korek, and PTW attacks. These attacks are highly successful against algorithms used for encrypting passwords.</p>
<p>FMS is normally used against RC4 encrypted passwords. WEP is attacked using Korek. WPA, WPA2, and WEP are attacked using the PTW attack15. The tool is thorough and almost always guarantees entry into networks that use weak passwords.</p>
<p>Following is a screenshot of Aircrack-ng:</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>This is an internal reconnaissance technique used specifically for surveying wireless networks and is commonly done from an automobile. It is targeted mostly at unsecured Wi-Fi networks. There are a few tools that have been made for the purpose of wardriving, and the two most common are network stumbler and mini stumbler. Network stumbler is Windows-based and it records SSIDs of unsecured wireless networks before using GPS satellites to record the exact location of the wireless network. The data is used to create a map used by other wardrivers to find unsecured or inadequately-secured wireless networks. They can then exploit the network and its devices since entrance is free.</p>
<p>Mini stumbler is a related tool, but has been designed to run on tablets and smartphones. This makes wardrivers look less suspicious when identifying or exploiting a network. The functionality of the tool will simply find an unsecured network and record it in an online database. Wardrivers can then come later on to exploit the network using a simplified map of all the identified networks. As for Linux, there is a tool called Kismet that can be used for wardriving.</p>
<p>The tool is said to be very powerful as it lists unsecured networks and details of the clients on networks such as BSSIDs, signal levels, and IP addresses. It can also list the identified networks on maps, allowing attackers to come back and attack the network using the known information. Primarily, the tool sniffs the 802.11 layer 2 traffic of a Wi-Fi network and uses any Wi-Fi adapter on the machine it has been installed in (1).</p>

<p>At the end of both stages of reconnaissance, attackers will have enough information to proceed or cancel a cyber-attack. From an external reconnaissance, they will know the behavior of users and use it to an organization's disadvantage. The aim is only to find some form of weakness that attackers can then use to gain entry to the networks or systems of an organization. Internal reconnaissance, on the other hand, will enable attackers to learn more about the network in question. Some of the discussed tools are extremely powerful and give so much information that it could be thought of as being leaked by the network designers themselves. The attackers become knowledgeable about the vulnerabilities they can exploit within a network or system of an organization. At the end of this stage, attackers are then able to engage an organization on two fronts: either from the users' side or internally from the network's vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>This chapter has given an in-depth view of the reconnaissance phase of cyber attacks. It has discussed external reconnaissance and brought out the ways through which attackers obtain information about an organization's network. It has shown just how easy it is to compromise humans and lead them into divulging sensitive information. It has exhaustively discussed social engineering, one of the most feared types of reconnaissance attacks today. The chapter has also gone through the tools used for internal reconnaissance. It has broadly looked at tools that can scan networks, and those that can be used to break into wireless networks.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, there will be an in-depth discussion of the ways in which hackers compromise systems using information that they obtained from this phase.</p>
