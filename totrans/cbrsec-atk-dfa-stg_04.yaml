    life cycle. This chapter will go into the first phase of the life cycle in depth—reconnaissance.
    Reconnaissance is one of the most important stages of a threat life cycle, where
    attackers search for vulnerabilities that they can use to attack targets. An attacker
    will be interested in locating and gathering data, and identifying any loopholes
    in a target's network, its users, or its computing systems. Reconnaissance is
    done both passively and actively, borrowing tactics that have been used by the
    military. It can be compared to the sending of spies into an enemy's territory
    to gather data about where and when to strike. When reconnaissance is done in
    the right way, the target should not be able to know that it is being done. This
    critical attack life cycle phase can be actualized in a number of ways, which
    are broadly classified as external and internal reconnaissance.

    bidding, sending to recyclers, or dumping them in storage. There are serious implications
    for these methods of disposal. Google is one of the companies that are thorough
    in the way they dispose of devices that may have contained user data. The company
    destroys its old hard drives from its data centers to prevent the data that they
    contained from being accessed by malicious people. The hard drives are put into
    a crusher that pushes steel pistons up the center of the disks, rendering them
    unreadable. This process continues until the machine spits out tiny pieces of
    the hard drive, which are then sent to a recycling center. This is a rigorous
    and fail-proof exercise. Some other companies are not able to do this and therefore
    opt to delete the data contained in old hard disks by using military-grade deletion
    software. This ensures that data cannot be recovered from old hard drives when
    they are disposed of.

    storage devices or obsolete computers. Some do not even bother to delete the contained
    data. Since these obsolete devices may be disposed of by sometimes careless means,
    attackers are able to easily obtain them from their points of disposal. The obsolete
    storage devices may give attackers a lot of information about the internal setup
    of an organization. It may also allow them to access openly-stored passwords on
    browsers, find out the privileges and details of different users, and may even
    give them access to some bespoke systems used in the network.

    to find out a lot of information about people today is by going through their
    social media accounts. Hackers have found social media to be the best place to
    mine data concerning specific targets, as people are likely to share information
    on such platforms. Of particular importance today is data related to the companies
    users work for. Other key pieces of information that can be obtained from social
    media accounts include details about family members, relatives, friends, and residence
    and contact information. As well as this, attackers have learned a new way of
    using social media to execute even more nefarious pre-attacks.

    how sophisticated hackers have become. The Pentagon official is said to have clicked
    on a post put up by a robot account about a holiday package. This is because Pentagon
    officials had been trained by cyber security experts to avoid clicking or opening
    attachments sent by mail. The official had clicked on a link that is said to have
    compromised his computer. Cyber security experts classified this as a spear phishing
    threat; however, instead of using emails, it used a social media post. Hackers
    are looking for this type of unpredictable, and sometimes unnoticeable, pre-attack.
    The attacker is said to have been able to access a wealth of sensitive information
    about the official through this attack.

- en: Another way that hackers exploit social media users is by going through their
    account posts to obtain information that can be used in passwords or as answers
    to secret questions used to reset some accounts. This is information such as a
    user's date of birth, their parent's maiden name, names of the street that they
    grew up in, pet names, school names, and other types of random information. Users
    are known to use weak passwords due to laziness or lack of knowledge about the
    threats that they face. It is, therefore, possible that some users use their birth
    dates as their work email passwords. Work emails are easy to guess since they
    use a person's official name and end in an organization's domain name. Armed with
    their official name from their social media accounts, as well as viable passwords,
    an attacker is able to plan how to get into a network and perform an attack.

    easy to create a fake account bearing the identity of another person. All that
    is needed is access to some pictures and up-to-date details of the identity theft
    victim. This is all in the playbook of hackers. They track information about organizations'
    users and their bosses. They can then create accounts with the names and details
    of the bosses. This will allow them to get favors or issue orders to oblivious
    users, even through the likes of social media. A confident hacker could even request
    network information and statistics from the IT department using the identity of
    a high-ranking employee. The hacker will continue to get information about the
    network's security, which will then enable him to find a way to hack into it successfully
    in the near future.

    target. A company can shield itself from many types of attack with security tools,
    but it cannot completely protect itself from this type of threat. Social engineering
    has been perfectly developed to exploit human nature—something beyond the protection
    of security tools. Hackers are aware that there exist very strong and powerful
    tools to prevent them from getting any type of information from organizational
    networks. Scanning and spoofing tools are easily identified by intrusion detection
    devices and firewalls. Therefore, it is somewhat difficult to beat today's level
    of security with the usual threats since their signatures are known and can easily
    be thwarted. The human component, on the other hand, is still open to attacks
    through manipulation. Humans are sympathetic, trusting of friends, show-offs,
    and obedient to higher authorities; they are easy to convince provided that one
    can bring them around to a certain way of thinking.

- en: There are six levers that social engineers use to get victims to talk. One of
    these is reciprocation, where a victim does something for a social media user
    who in turn feels the need to reciprocate the favor. It is part of human nature
    to feel obligated to return a favor to a person, and attackers have come to know
    and exploit this. Another lever is scarcity, where a social engineer will get
    compliance from a target by threatening a short supply of something that the target
    is in need of. It could be a trip, a mega sale, or a new release of products.
    A lot of work is done to find out a target's likes in order to enable social engineers
    to pull this lever. The next lever is consistency, whereby humans tend to honor
    promises or get used to the usual flow of events. When an organization always
    orders and receives IT consumables from a certain vendor, it is very easy for
    attackers to clone the vendor and deliver malware-infected electronics.

- en: 'Another lever is liking, whereby humans are more likely to comply with the
    requests of people they like or those that appear attractive. Social engineers
    are experts at making themselves sound and appear attractive to easily win the
    compliance of targets. A commonly used lever that has a high success rate is authority.
    Generally, humans are obedient to the authority of those that are ranked above
    them; they can therefore easily bend the rules for them and grant their wishes
    even if they seem malicious. Many users will give their login credentials if a
    high-ranking IT employee requests them. In addition, many users will not think
    twice if their manager or director asks them to send some sensitive data over
    unsecured channels. It is easy to use this lever and many people can easily fall
    victim. The last lever is social validation: humans will readily comply and do
    something if other people are doing the same, as they do not want to appear the
    odd one out. All a hacker needs to do is make something appear normal and then
    request an unsuspicious user to do the same.'

    some information or perform unusual actions. It involves the construction of an
    elaborate lie that has been well-researched so as to appear legitimate to the
    target. This technique has been able to get accountants to release huge amounts
    of money to imaginary bosses who issue an order for payment into a certain account.
    It is therefore very easy for a hacker to use this technique to steal login credentials
    of users, or to get access to some sensitive files. Pretexting can be used to
    mediate an even bigger social engineering attack that will use the legitimate
    information to construe another lie. Social engineers that use pretexting have
    honed the art of impersonating other trusted individuals in society, such as police
    officers, debt collectors, tax officials, clergy, or investigators.

    its success rate is still surprisingly high. Phishing is mainly a technique that
    is used to obtain sensitive information about a company or a specific person in
    a fraudulent way. The normal execution of this attack involves a hacker sending
    emails to a target, pretending to be a legitimate third-party organization requesting
    information for verification purposes. The attacker normally attaches dire consequences
    to the lack of provision of the requested information. A link leading to a malicious
    or fraudulent website is also attached and the users are advised to use it to
    access a certain legitimate website. The attackers will have made a replica website,
    complete with logos and usual content, as well as a form to fill in with sensitive
    information. The idea is to capture the details of a target that will enable the
    attacker to commit a bigger crime. Targeted information includes login credentials,
    social security numbers, and bank details. Attackers are still using this technique
    to capture sensitive information from users of a certain company so that they
    can use it to access its networks and systems in future attacks.

    hackers were sending phishing emails claiming to be from a certain court and ordering
    the recipients to appear before the court at a certain date. The email came with
    a link that enabled recipients to view more details about the court notice. However,
    upon clicking the link, the recipients installed malware on their computers that
    was used for other malicious purposes, such as key logging and the collection
    of stored login credentials in browsers.

    of the month of April, when many people were anxiously waiting for possible refunds
    from the IRS, and sent emails claiming to be from the IRS, attaching ransomware
    through a Word file. When recipients opened the Word document, the ransomware
    would encrypt the user's files in the hard disk and any connected external storage
    device.

    a famous job board company called CareerBuilder. Here, hackers pretended to be
    normal job applicants, but instead of attaching resumes they uploaded malicious
    files. CareerBuilder then forwarded these CVs to multiple companies that were
    hiring. It was the ultimate hack, which saw malware transferred to many organizations.
    There have also been multiple police departments that have fallen prey to ransomware.
    In New Hampshire, a police officer clicked on an email that appeared legitimate
    and the computer that he was using was infected with ransomware. This has happened
    to many other police departments across the world, which shows the amount of power
    that phishing still has.

    of emails. It is an advanced level of a phishing attack whereby the attacker will
    use an illegitimate interactive voice response system that sounds exactly like
    the ones used by banks, service providers, and so on. This attack is mostly used
    as an extension of the email phishing attack to make a target reveal secret information.
    A toll-free number is normally provided, which when called leads the target to
    the rogue interactive voice response system. The target will be prompted by the
    system to give out some verification information. It is normal for the system
    to reject input that a target gives so as to ensure that several PINs are disclosed.
    This is enough for the attackers to proceed and steal money from a target, be
    it a person or an organization. In extreme cases, a target will be forwarded to
    a fake customer care agent to assist with failed login attempts. The fake agent
    will continue questioning the target, gaining even more sensitive information.

    volumes of emails in a random manner. Spear phishing is specifically targeted
    to obtain information from particular end users in an organization. Spear phishing
    is more strenuous since it requires the attackers to perform a number of background
    checks on targets in order to identify a victim that they can pursue. Attackers
    will then carefully craft an email that addresses something of interest to the
    target, coercing him or her to open it. Statistically, normal phishing has a 3%
    success rate, whereas spear phishing has a 70% success rate. It is also said that
    only 5% of people who open phishing emails click links or download any attachments,
    while almost half of all people who open spear phishing emails click on their
    links and download attachments.

    targeting a staff member in the HR department. These are employees that have to
    be in constant contact with the world when seeking new talent. A spear phisher
    might craft an email accusing the department of corruption or nepotism, providing
    a link to a website where disgruntled—and fictional—potential employees have been
    complaining. HR staff members are not necessarily very knowledgeable about IT-related
    issues, and therefore might easily click on such links, and as a result get infected.
    From one single infection, malware can easily spread inside an organization by
    making its way through to the HR server, which almost every organization has.

    that users give to websites they regularly visit, such as interactive chat forums
    and exchange boards. Users on these websites are more likely to act in abnormally
    careless manners. Even the most careful people, who avoid clicking links in emails,
    will not hesitate to click on links provided on these types of website. These
    websites are referred to as watering holes because hackers trap their victims
    there just as predators wait to catch their prey at watering holes. Here, hackers
    exploit any vulnerabilities on the website, attack them, take charge, and then
    inject code that infects visitors with malware or that leads clicks to malicious
    pages. Due to the nature of the planning done by the attackers that choose this
    method, these attacks are normally tailored to a specific target and specific
    devices, operating systems, or applications that they use. It is used against
    some of the most IT-knowledgeable people, such as system administrators. An example
    of water holing is the exploitation of vulnerabilities in a site such as StackOverflow.com,
    which is often frequented by IT personnel. If the site is bugged, a hacker could
    inject malware into the computers of the visiting IT staff.

    simplest social engineering techniques since all that it involves is an external
    storage device (1). An attacker will leave a malware-infected external storage
    device in a place where other people can easily find it. It could be in the washroom
    of an organization, in the elevator, at the reception desk, on the pavement, or
    even in the parking lot. Greedy or curious users in an organization will then
    retrieve the object and hurriedly plug it into their machines. Attackers are normally
    crafty and will leave files in the flash drive that a victim will be tempted to
    open. For example, a file labeled "the executive summary of salaries and upcoming
    promotions" is likely to get the attention of many.

    drives and then drop a few around the organization where they can be picked up
    by some of its staff. Eventually, they will end up being plugged into a computer
    and files will be opened. Attackers will have planted malware to infect the computers
    the flash drive is plugged into. Computers configured to auto-run devices once
    plugged in are in greater danger, since no user action is required to initiate
    the malware infection process.

    drive that infect computers when they boot, while an infected secondary storage
    media is then connected to them. This will give attackers a higher level of access
    to the computer and the ability to move undetected. Baiting has a high success
    rate because it is human nature to either be greedy or curious and open and read
    files that are above their level of access. This is why attackers will choose
    to label storage media or files with tempting titles such as "confidential" or
    "executive" since internal employees are always interested in such things.

    and analyze potential targets to attack in the future. Internal reconnaissance

    There are many cyber security tools that have been made to mitigate software used
    to perform reconnaissance attacks. However, most organizations never install enough
    security tools and hackers keep on finding ways to hack through the already-installed

    and Mac, you need to make sure that a device, preferably a laptop, installed with
    Wireshark is connected to a network. Wireshark needs to be started so that it
    can capture packets. After a given period of time, one can stop Wireshark and
    proceed to perform the analysis. To get passwords, one needs to filter the data
    captured to show only the POST data. This is because most websites use the POST
    to transfer authentication information to their servers. It will list all the
    POST data actions that were made. One will then right-click on any of these and
    select the option to follow the TCP stream. Wireshark will open a window showing
    a username and password. At times, the captured password is hashed, and this is
    common with websites. One can easily crack the hash value and recover the original
    password using other tools.

    Since it is open source, the community continually updates its capabilities and
    therefore will continue to add new features. Its current basic features include
    capturing packets, importing `pcap` files, displaying protocol information about
    packets, exporting captured packets in multiple formats, colorizing packets based
    on filters, giving statistics about a network, and the ability to search through
    captured packets. The file has advanced capabilities, and these make it ideal
    for hacking. The open source community, however, uses it for white hacking, which
    discovers vulnerabilities in networks before black hats do.

    but effective. It tops most other scanning tools with its fast speeds, which it
    achieves in two ways. The tool contains a process that sends multiple queries
    at once and another process that receives the responses and integrates them. The
    two processes do not consult and therefore the receiving process never knows what
    to expect—just that there will be response packets. There is, however, a clever
    hash-based way that is integrated into the tool that allows you to see the valid
    responses that it receives from scanning. The tool is totally different from old
    scanning tools such as NMap, and its advancements enable it to be quicker and
    more effective at capturing packets.

    It is among the best network scanners and has bagged several awards for being
    the best vulnerability scanner for white hats. Nessus has several functionalities
    that may come in handy for an attacker doing internal reconnaissance. The tool
    can scan a network and show connected devices that have misconfigurations and
    missing patches. The tool also shows the devices that are using their default
    passwords, weak passwords, or have no passwords at all.

    extra functionality. When it begins scanning a network, it can call to NMap to
    help it scan for open ports and will automatically integrate the data that NMap
    collects. Nessus is then able to use this type of data to continue scanning and

- en: This is an internal reconnaissance technique used specifically for surveying
    wireless networks and is commonly done from an automobile. It is targeted mostly
    at unsecured Wi-Fi networks. There are a few tools that have been made for the
    purpose of wardriving, and the two most common are network stumbler and mini stumbler.
    Network stumbler is Windows-based and it records SSIDs of unsecured wireless networks
    before using GPS satellites to record the exact location of the wireless network.
    The data is used to create a map used by other wardrivers to find unsecured or
    inadequately-secured wireless networks. They can then exploit the network and
    its devices since entrance is free.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Mini stumbler is a related tool, but has been designed to run on tablets and
    smartphones. This makes wardrivers look less suspicious when identifying or exploiting
    a network. The functionality of the tool will simply find an unsecured network
    and record it in an online database. Wardrivers can then come later on to exploit
    the network using a simplified map of all the identified networks. As for Linux,
    there is a tool called Kismet that can be used for wardriving.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The tool is said to be very powerful as it lists unsecured networks and details
    of the clients on networks such as BSSIDs, signal levels, and IP addresses. It
    can also list the identified networks on maps, allowing attackers to come back
    and attack the network using the known information. Primarily, the tool sniffs
    the 802.11 layer 2 traffic of a Wi-Fi network and uses any Wi-Fi adapter on the
    machine it has been installed in (1).

- en: 'At the end of both stages of reconnaissance, attackers will have enough information
    to proceed or cancel a cyber-attack. From an external reconnaissance, they will
    know the behavior of users and use it to an organization''s disadvantage. The
    aim is only to find some form of weakness that attackers can then use to gain
    entry to the networks or systems of an organization. Internal reconnaissance,
    on the other hand, will enable attackers to learn more about the network in question.
    Some of the discussed tools are extremely powerful and give so much information
    that it could be thought of as being leaked by the network designers themselves.
    The attackers become knowledgeable about the vulnerabilities they can exploit
    within a network or system of an organization. At the end of this stage, attackers
    are then able to engage an organization on two fronts: either from the users''
    side or internally from the network''s vulnerabilities.'
