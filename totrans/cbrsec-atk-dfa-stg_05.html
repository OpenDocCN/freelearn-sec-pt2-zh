<p>The previous chapter gave you an idea of the precursor of an attack. It discussed tools and techniques used to gather information about a target so that an attack can be planned and executed. It also touched on the external and internal reconnaissance techniques. This chapter will discuss how actual attacks are conducted after information about the target is collected in the reconnaissance phase. It will discuss the visible trends in the choice of attack tools, techniques, and targets by hackers. It will discuss how phishing can be crafted to carry out an actual attack, as well as zero-day exploits and the methods hackers use to discover them. Finally, the chapter will then go into a step-by-step discussion of how one can carry out attacks against computers, servers, and websites.</p>
<p>The outline of the topics is as follows:</p>

<p>Over time, hackers have proven to cyber security experts that they can be persistent, more creative, and increasingly sophisticated with their attacks. They have learned how to adapt to changes in the IT landscape so that they can always be effective when they launch attacks. Even though there is no Moore's law, or its equivalent in the context of cyberattacks, it can be said that hacking techniques become more sophisticated each year. In the last few years, there has been an observed trend in terms of the preferred attacks and modes of execution. These include:</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Extortion attacks</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Previously, in most instances, hackers have been getting revenues for selling stolen data from companies. However, in the last three years, they have been seen using another tactic: extorting money directly from their victims. They may either hold computer files to ransom or threaten to release damaging information about a victim to the public. In both instances, they request money to be paid before a certain deadline expires. One of the most famous extortion attempts is the WannaCry ransomware that came about in May 2017. The WannaCry ransomware infected hundreds of thousands of computers in over 150 countries. From Russia to the US, whole organizations were brought to a halt after users were locked out of their data, which had been encrypted. The ransomware attempted to extort users by asking for $300 to be paid to a Bitcoin address within 72 hours, after which the amount would double. There was also a stern warning of having files locked permanently if payment was not made within 7 days.</p>
<p>WannaCry reportedly only made $50,000 since a kill switch was discovered in its code. However, it had the potential to do lots of damage. Experts say that if the code did not include a kill switch, the ransomware would either still be around or would have claimed many computers. Shortly after WannaCry was mitigated, a new ransomware was reported. The ransomware hit computers in Ukraine, which were reported to be in the range of the tens of thousands. Russia was also affected, with computers used to monitor the Chernobyl nuclear plant being compromised, causing employees on-site to fall back to the noncomputerized monitoring means such as observation. Some companies in the US and Australia were also affected.</p>
<p>Prior to these international incidents, there had been local and isolated cases of ransomware at different companies. Apart from ransomware, hackers have been extorting money by threatening to hack sites. The Ashley Madison incident is a good example of this type of extortion. After failed extortion attempts, hackers exposed the user data of millions of people. The owners of the website did not take the threats that hackers had made seriously, and therefore did not pay up or shut down the website as they had been ordered. Hackers actualized their threats when they publicly released details of users that had registered on the site. Some of these people had registered using work details, such as work emails. In July, it was confirmed that the company offered to pay a total of $11 million to compensate for the exposure of 36 million users. A similar extortion case faced a United Arab Emirates bank called Sharjah in 2015. The hacker held the user data to ransom and demanded a payment of $3 million<span> from the bank. The hacker periodically released some of the user data on Twitter after a number of hours. The bank also downplayed the</span> threats, <span>and even had Twitter block the account he had been using. This reprieve was short-lived as the hacker created a new account, and in an act of vengeance released the user data which contained personal details of the account owners, their transactions, and details of the entities that they had transacted with. The hacker even reached out to some of the users via text.</span></p>
<p>These incidents show that extortion attacks are on the rise and are becoming preferred by hackers. Hackers are getting into systems with a goal of copying as much data as possible and then successfully holding it to ransom for huge amounts of money. Logistically, this is viewed as simpler than trying to sell off stolen data to third parties. Hackers are also able to negotiate for more money as the data they hold is more valuable to owners than it is to third parties. Extortion attacks such as ransomware have also become effective since there is hardly any decryption workaround, other than having to pay up.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Data manipulation attacks</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Another visible trend in the way that hackers compromise systems is through the manipulation of data instead of deleting or releasing it. This is because such attacks compromise the integrity of data. There is no agony that hackers can cause to a target that is greater than making it distrust the integrity of its own data. Data manipulation can be trivial, at times changing just a single value, but the consequences can be far-reaching. Data manipulation is often difficult to detect and hackers might even manipulate data in backup storage to ensure that there is no recovery. In one real-world example, Chinese spies have been known to attack US defense contractor networks to steal blueprints. It is, (22) however, feared that they might have also been manipulating the data used by the contractors. This might, in turn, sabotage the integrity of weapons supplied to the US or introduce changes in the ways they operate such that third parties could have a level of control too.</p>
<p>Data manipulation is said to be the next stage of cybercrime, and it is anticipated that there will be many more cases of it in the near future. US industries have been said to be unprepared for these kinds of attack. Cybersecurity experts have been warning of imminent threats of manipulation attacks on health care, financial, and government data. This is because hackers have previously, and are still able to, steal data from industries and government institutions including the FBI. A slight escalation of these attacks would have greater consequences on all organizations. For example, for an institution such as a bank, data manipulation could be catastrophic. It is plausible that hackers can break into a bank system, access the database and make changes before proceeding to implement the same changes on the bank's backup storage. It may sound far-fetched, but with insider threats, this can easily happen. If the hackers are able to manipulate both the actual and backup databases to show different values as customer balances, there would be chaos. Withdrawals could be suspended, and it would take the bank months, or even years, to determine the actual customer balances.</p>
<p>These are the types of attacks that hackers will be looking at in the future. Not only will they cause anguish to users, they will also enable hackers to demand more money to return data to its correct state. It is convenient for them that many organizations are not paying close enough attention to the security of their own databases. Data manipulation attacks could also be used to provide misinformation to the masses. This is a problem that publicly traded companies should be worried about. A good example is when hackers were able to hack into the official Twitter account of The Associated Press and tweet a news story that the Dow had dropped by 150 points. The impact of this was an actual deflation of the Dow by an estimated $136 billion. As seen, this is an attack that can affect any company and hurt its profits.</p>
<p>There are many people who have motives, especially competitors, to bring down other companies in whichever way possible. There is a great concern of the level of unpreparedness of most businesses in protecting the integrity of their data. Most organizations depend on automated backups, but do not go the extra step of ensuring that the data stored has not been manipulated. This small act of laziness is easily exploitable by hackers. Predictions are that unless organizations pay attention to the integrity of their data, data manipulation attacks will increase rapidly.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">IoT device attacks</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>This is an emerging and rapidly growing technology, where hackers are targeting <strong>Internet of Things</strong> (<strong>IoT</strong>) devices available, from smart home appliances to baby monitors. The IoT is going to see an increase in connected cars, sensors, medical devices, lights, houses, power grids, and monitoring cameras, among many other things. Since the market-wide spread of IoT devices, a few attacks have already been witnessed. In most of them, the attacks were aimed at commandeering large networks made up of these devices to execute even larger attacks. Networks of CCTV cameras and IoT lights have been used to cause <strong>distributed denial of service</strong> (<strong>DDoS</strong>) attacks against banks and even schools.</p>
<p>Hackers are exploiting the huge numbers of these devices to concentrate efforts at generating voluminous illegitimate traffic capable of taking down the servers of organizations that offer online services. These will retire botnets that have been made of unsuspicious user computers. This is because IoT devices are easier to access, are already available in large numbers, and are not adequately protected. Experts have warned that most IoT devices are not secure and most of the blame has fallen on the manufacturers. In a rush to capitalize on the profits that this new technology has, many manufacturers of IoT products have not been prioritizing the security of their devices. Users, on the other hand, are lazy, and experts say that most users leave IoT devices with their default security configurations. With the world heading towards the automation of many tasks through IoT devices, cyberattackers will have many pawns to play around with, meaning IoT-related attacks could increase rapidly.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Backdoors</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>In 2016, one of the leading network device manufacturers, Juniper Networks, found that some of its firewalls had firmware that contained backdoors installed by hackers. The backdoors enabled hackers to decrypt traffic flowing through the firewalls. It clearly meant that the hackers wanted to infiltrate organizations that had bought firewalls from the company. Juniper Networks said that such a hack could only have been actualized by a government agency with enough resources to handle traffic flowing in and out of many networks. The <strong>National Security Agency</strong> (<strong>NSA</strong>) was put in the spotlight since the backdoor had similarities to another one that was also attributed to the agency. Although it is unclear who was actually responsible for the backdoor, the incident brings up a big threat.</p>
<p>Hackers seem to be adopting the use of backdoors. This is being actualized by compromising one of the companies in the supply chain that delivers cyber-related products to consumers. In the discussed incident, the backdoor was planted at the manufacturer's premises, and therefore any organization that bought a firewall from them was infiltrated by the hacker. There have been other incidents where backdoors have been delivered embedded in a software. Companies selling legitimate software on their websites have also become targets for hackers. Hackers have been inserting codes to create backdoors into legit software in a manner that the backdoor will be harder to find. It is one of the adaptations that hackers are having to take due to the evolution of cybersecurity products. Since these types of backdoor are hard to find, it is expected that they will be extensively used by hackers in the near future.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Mobile device attacks</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>According to a leading cybersecurity company called Symantec, there has been a gradual increase in malicious activity targeting mobile devices. The most targeted <strong>operating system</strong> (<strong>OS</strong>) is Android, since it has the highest number of users so far. However, the OS has been making several security improvements in its architecture, making it more difficult for hackers to infect devices running on it. The cybersecurity company says that out of the total number of Android-based devices that have been installed, it has blocked about 18 million attacks in 2016 alone. This was double the number of attacks blocked in 2015, where it reported only 9 million attack attempts. The security company also reported that there was a rise in the growth of mobile malware. It is believed that these will become more prevalent in the future. The malware it noted was that of generated fraudulent click adverts and those that downloaded ransomware onto mobile phones.</p>
<p>One particular case of malware was one that actually sent premium messages on victim's phones and therefore generated revenues for its makers. There were also detections of malware used to steal personal information from their victims' devices. Since mobile device attacks are presumably doubling every year, Symantec may report over 30 million attack attempts in its 2017 report. The increase in mobile phone attacks is attributed to the low level of protection that users afford their smartphones. While people are willing to ensure that they have an antivirus program running on their computers, most smartphone users are unconcerned about attacks that hackers can carry out on their devices. Smartphones have browsers and web-supported apps that are vulnerable to scripting attacks, and they are also exploitable through the man-in-the-middle attack. In addition, new attacks are emerging; in September 2017, zero-day vulnerabilities were discovered. One of these was BlueBorne, which can take over any Bluetooth-enabled device and infect it with malware.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>There has been a growing focus of hackers to nonobvious targets in corporate networks, which to other people, seem to be harmless and therefore are not accorded any type of security. These are peripherals such as printers and scanners, preferably those that have been assigned an IP address for the purposes of sharing. Hackers have been hacking into these devices, and in particular printers, since modern printers come with an inbuilt memory function and only basic security features. The most common security features include password authentication mechanisms. However, these basic security measures are not enough to deter motivated hackers. Hackers have been using printers for corporate espionage by gathering the sensitive data that users send to be printed. Printers have also been used as entry points into otherwise secure networks. Hackers can easily hack into a network using an unsecured printer instead of using the more difficult way of having to compromise a computer or server within a network.</p>
<p>In a recent shocking exposé by WikiLeaks, it was alleged that the NSA has been hacking Samsung smart TVs. An exploit codenamed "Weeping Angel" was leaked and found to exploit the always-on voice command system of Samsung smart TVs to spy on people in a room by recording their conversations and transmitting them to a <strong>Central Intelligence Agency</strong> (<strong>CIA</strong>) server. This has drawn criticism directed at both Samsung and the CIA. Users are now complaining to Samsung about the voice command feature since it puts them inherently at risk of being spied on by anyone. A hacking group called the Shadow Brokers has also been leaking NSA exploits, which other hackers have been using to make dangerous malware. It may only be a matter of time before the group releases the exploit for Samsung TVs, and this could see cyberattackers start hacking similar devices that use voice commands.</p>
<p>There is also a risk that hackers will target home devices more frequently, provided that they are connected to the internet. This is in an attempt to grow botnet networks using devices other than computers. Noncomputing devices are easier to hack into and commandeer. Most users are careless and leave network-connected devices at their default configurations with the passwords supplied by manufacturers. There is a growing trend of hacking into such devices, whereby attackers are able to take over hundreds of thousands of them and use them in their botnets.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>One of the fastest growing technologies today is the cloud. This is because of its incomparable flexibility, accessibility, and capacity. However, cybersecurity experts have been warning that the cloud is not secure, and the increasing number of attacks orchestrated on the cloud has added weight to these claims. There is one great vulnerability in the cloud: everything is shared. People and organizations have to share storage space, CPU cores, and network interfaces. Therefore, it only requires hackers to go past the boundaries that cloud vendors have established to prevent people from accessing each other's data. Since the vendor owns the hardware, he/she has ways to bypass these boundaries. This is what hackers are always counting on in order to make their way into the backend of the cloud where all the data resides. There is a limit to the extent to which individual organizations can ensure the security of the data that they store in the cloud. The security environment of the cloud is largely determined by the vendor. While individual organizations might be able to offer unbreakable security to its local servers, they cannot extend the same to the cloud. There are risks that arise when cybersecurity becomes the responsibility of another party. The vendor may not be so thorough with the security afforded to clients' data. The cloud also involves the use of shared platforms with other people, yet a cloud user is only given limited access controls. Security is majorly left to the vendor.</p>
<p>There are many other reasons why cybersecurity experts fear that the cloud is not safe. In the last two years, there has been an upward growth of incidences of cloud vendors and companies using the cloud being attacked. Target is one of the organizations that has fallen victim to cloud hacks. Through phishing emails, hackers were able to get credentials used for the organization's cloud servers. Once authenticated, they were able to steal the credit card details of up to 70 million customers. The organization is said to have been warned several times about the possibility of such an attack, but these warnings were overlooked. In 2014, a year after the Target incident, Home Depot found itself in the same position after hackers were able to steal the details of about 56 million credit cards and compromise over 50 million emails belonging to clients. The hackers used a malware on a point of sale system in the organization. They were able to gather enough information to enable them to access the cloud of the organization from where they started stealing data. Sony Pictures was also hacked, and the attackers were able to obtain from the organization's cloud servers employee information, financial details, sensitive emails, and even unreleased films. In 2015, hackers were able to access details of more than 100,000 accounts from the US <strong>Internal Revenue Service</strong> (<strong>IRS</strong>). The details included social security numbers, dates of birth, and individuals' actual addresses. The said details were stolen from the IRS's cloud servers.</p>
<p>There have been many other hacks where huge amounts of data have been stolen from cloud platforms. Even though it would be unfair to demonize the cloud, it is clear that many organizations are not yet ready to adopt it. In the discussed attacks, the cloud was not the direct target: hackers had to compromise a user or a system within an organization. Unlike organizational servers, it is hard for individuals to know when an intruder is illegally accessing data in a cloud. Despite their low levels of preparedness for the threats that come with the cloud, many organizations are still adopting it. A lot of sensitive data is being put at risk on cloud platforms. Hackers have therefore decided to focus on this type of data, which is easy to access once authenticated into the cloud. There is, therefore, a growing number of incidences being reported where organizations are losing data stored on the cloud to hackers.</p>
<p>Another important fact to consider regarding the cloud is the identity that resides there, and how this identity has been the target of attacks. In the <em>Microsoft Security Intelligence Report</em> Volume 22, which analyzes data from January to March 2017, it was revealed that cloud-based Microsoft accounts saw a 300% increase in cyberattacks form Q1 2016 to Q1 2017.</p>
<p>The following section will discuss the actual ways that hackers use to compromise systems. It will touch on how phishing attacks are crafted not just to collect data but to compromise a system. It will also discuss zero-day vulnerabilities and how hackers discover them. It will then deep-dive into different ways in which computers and web-based systems use different techniques and tools.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Phishing</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The previous chapter discussed phishing as an external reconnaissance technique used to obtain data from users in an organization. It was categorized as a social engineering method of reconnaissance. Phishing can, however, be used in two ways: it can be the precursor to an attack or as an attack itself. As a reconnaissance attack, the hackers are mostly interested in getting information from users. As was discussed, they might disguise themselves as a trustworthy third-party organization, such as a bank, and simply trick users into giving out secretive information. They might also try to take advantage of a user's greed, emotions, fears, obsessions, and carelessness. However, when phishing is used as an actual attack to compromise a system, the phishing emails come carrying some payloads. Hackers may use attachments or links in the emails to compromise a user's computer. When the attack is done via attachments, users may be enticed into downloading an attached file that may turn out to be malware.</p>
<p>At times, the attached files could be legitimate Word or PDF documents that seemingly present no harm. However, these files may also contain malicious codes within them and may execute when a user opens them. Hackers are also crafty, and may create a malicious website and insert a link to it in phishing emails. For example, users may be told that there has been a security breach in their online bank account and will then go to change their passwords via a certain link. The link might lead the user to a replica website from where all the details a user gives will be stolen. The email may have a link that first directs the user to a malicious website, installs a malware, and then almost immediately redirects them to the genuine website. In all of these instances, authentication information is stolen and is then used to fraudulently transfer money or steal files.</p>
<p>One technique that is growing is the use of social media notification messages that entice users to click on a link. The example that follows appears to be a notification message from Facebook telling the user that he missed some activities. At this point, the user may feel tempted to click on the hyperlink:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="354" width="491" src="assets/37269778-b7bb-4489-9e70-c764914d9616.jpg"/></div>
<p>In this particular case, the hyperlink to <span class="packt_screen">1 unread message</span> was redirecting the user to a malicious URL. How do we know it is malicious? One way to quickly verify a URL is by going to <a href="http://www.virustotal.com"><span class="URLPACKT">www.virustotal.com</span></a>, where you can paste the URL and see a result similar to the one shown as follows, which shows the results for the URL presented in the hyperlink. However, this is not a foolproof method, as hackers can use tools, such as Shelter, to verify their phishing resources:</p>

<p>Hackers have been known to take the time to study the systems used by targets in order to identify any vulnerabilities. For instance, WikiLeaks has often said that the NSA does the same thing, and so far a database of vulnerabilities exists on computing devices, commonly used software systems, and even everyday devices. Their stored exploits have been outed by a hacking group called The Shadow Brokers, who regularly leak some of the vulnerabilities that the agency keeps. Some of the previously released vulnerabilities have been used by black hats to create powerful malware such as WannaCry. To summarize, there are hacking groups and many other government agencies studying software systems to find exploitable vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>The exploitation of vulnerabilities is done when hackers take advantage of bugs in a software system; this could be within an operating system, the kernel, or a web-based system. The vulnerabilities provide loopholes through which hackers can perform malicious actions. These could be errors in the authentication code, bugs within the account management system, or just any other unforeseen error by the developers. Software system developers constantly give users updates and upgrades as a response to the observed or reported bugs in their systems. This is known as patch management, which is a standard procedure at many companies that specialize in the making of systems.</p>

<p>As has been mentioned, many software-developing companies have rigorous patch management, and therefore they always update their software whenever a vulnerability is discovered. This frustrates hacking efforts targeted at exploiting vulnerabilities that software developers have already patched. As an adaptation to this, hackers have discovered zero-day attacks. Zero-day attacks use advanced vulnerability discovery tools and techniques to identify vulnerabilities that are not yet known by software developers. Some of the commonly used tools and techniques implemented by hackers to find zero-day vulnerabilities are as follows.</p>

<p>This involves the recreation of a system by the hacker in an attempt to find a vulnerability. Through fuzzing, hackers can determine all the safety precautions that system developers have to put into consideration and the types of bugs that they had to fix while making the system. An attacker also has a higher chance of creating a vulnerability that can be successfully used against modules of the target system. This process is effective since a hacker gains a full understanding of the working of a system, as well as where and how it can be compromised. However, it is often too cumbersome to use, especially when dealing with large programs.</p>

<p>This is done for systems that release their source code to the public or through open source under a BSD/GNU license. A knowledgeable hacker in the languages used to code a system might be able to identify bugs in the source code. This method is simpler and quicker than fuzzing. However, its success rate is lower, since it is not very easy to pinpoint errors from merely looking at code.</p>
<p>Another approach is to use specific tools to identify vulnerabilities in the code, and Checkmarx (<a href="http://www.checkmarx.com"><span class="URLPACKT">www.checkmarx.com</span></a>) is an example of that. Checkmarx can scan the code and quickly identify, categorize, and suggest countermeasures for vulnerabilities in the code.</p>
<p>The following figure shows a screenshot of the IDA PRO tool. In the screenshot, the tool has already identified 25 SQL injection vulnerabilities and two stored XSS vulnerabilities in the supplied code:</p>

<p>If you don't have access to the source code, it is still possible to obtain some relevant information by performing a reverse engineering analysis using tools such as IDA PRO (<span class="URLPACKT">www.hex-rays.com</span>):</p>

<p>In this example, IDA Pro is disassembling a program called <span class="packt_screen">evil.exe</span>, further analysis that disassembled code can reveal more detail about what this program is doing.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that protecting against zero-day exploits is one of the most challenging aspect of everyday operations for the Blue Team. However, if you know the behavior, and not how it works, it can help you to identify patterns and potentially take action to protect the system. The following sections will give you more detail about the different types of zero-day exploits.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>Buffer overflows are caused by the use of incorrect logic in the codes of a system. Hackers will identify areas where these overflows can be exploited in a system. They execute the exploit by instructing a system to write data to a buffer memory but not to observe the memory restrictions of the buffer. The system will end up writing data past the acceptable limit, which will therefore overflow to parts of the memory. The main aim of this type of exploit is to cause a system to crash in a controllable way. It is a common zero-day exploit since it is easy for an attacker to identify areas in a program where an overflow can happen.</p>
<p>Attackers can also exploit existing buffer overflow vulnerabilities in an unpatched system, for example the CVE -2010-3939 addresses a buffer overflow vulnerability in the <kbd>win32k.sys</kbd> module in the kernel-mode drivers of Windows Server 2008 R2.</p>

            <article>
                
<p><strong>Structured exception handling</strong> (<strong>SEH</strong>) is an exception handling mechanism included in most programs to make them robust and reliable. It is used to handle many types of errors and any exceptions that arise during the normal execution of an application. SEH exploits happen when the exception handler of an application is manipulated, causing it to force an application to close. Hackers normally attack the logic of the SEH, causing it to correct nonexistent errors and lead a system to a graceful shutdown. This technique is sometimes used with buffer overflows to ensure that a system brought down by overflows is closed to prevent unnecessary and excessive damage.</p>
<p>In the following section we will discuss some of the common ways that hackers compromise systems. More focus will be laid on how to compromise Windows operating systems using Linux-based tools, since most computers and a significant percentage of servers run on Windows. The attacks discussed will be launched from BackTrack 5, a Linux distribution that is focused on security. The same distribution is what hackers and penetration testers commonly use to compromise systems. Some of the tools that will be covered have been discussed in the previous chapter.</p>

<p>One of the main tasks of the Blue Team is to understand the cyber kill chain fully, and how it can be used against an organization's infrastructure. The Red Team, on the other hand, can use simulation exercises to identify breaches, and the results of this exercise can help to enhance the overall security posture of the organization.</p>
<p>The core macro steps to be followed are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Deploy the payloads</li>
<li>Compromise the operations system</li>
<li>Compromise the web-based system</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice that these steps will vary according to the attacker's mission, or the Red Team's target exercise. The intent here is to give you a core plan that you can customize according to your organization's needs.</p>

<p>Assuming that the entire public recon process was done to identify the target that you want to attack, you now need to build a payload that can exploit an existing vulnerability in the system. The following section will go over some strategies that you can implement to perform this operation.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Installing and using a vulnerability scanner</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Here, we have selected the Nessus vulnerability scanner. As mentioned previously, any attack must begin with a scanning or sniffing tool that is part of the recon phase. Nessus can be installed in the hacker's machine using the Linux terminal with the command <kbd>apt-get install Nessus</kbd>. After installing Nessus, a hacker will create an account to log in to in order to use the tool in the future. The tool is then started on BackTrack and will be accessible from the local host (127.0.0.1) at port <kbd>8834</kbd> using any web browser. The tool requires Adobe Flash to be installed in the browser that it is opened in. From there, it gives a login prompt that will authenticate the hacker into the full functionalities of the tool.</p>
<p>In the Nessus tool, there is a scanning functionality in the menu bar. This is where a user enters the IP addresses of the targets that are to be scanned by the scanning tool and then either launches an immediate or a delayed scan. The tool gives a report after scanning the individual hosts that the scan was carried out on. It will categorize vulnerabilities into either high, medium, or low priority. It will also give the number of open ports that can be exploited. The high priority vulnerabilities are the ones that hackers will usually target as they easily give them information on how to exploit systems using an attack tool. At this point, a hacker installs an attack tool in order to facilitate the exploitation of the vulnerabilities identified by the Nessus tool, or any other scanning tool.</p>
<p>The following figure shows a screenshot of the Nessus tool displaying a vulnerability report of a previously scanned target:</p>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="449" width="799" src="assets/a62450a8-08dc-4acd-9091-19d448cfcd50.png"/></div>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Using Metasploit</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Metasploit has been selected as the attack tool because most hackers and penetration testers use it. It is also easy to access since it comes preinstalled in the BackTrack Linux distribution, as well as Kali. Since exploits keep on being added to the framework, most users will update it every time they want to use it. The framework's console can be booted up by giving the command msfconsole in the terminal.</p>
<p>The <kbd>msfconsole</kbd> has a hive of exploits and payloads that can be used against different vulnerabilities that a hacker has already identified using the scanning tool previously discussed. There is a search command that allows users of the framework to narrow down their results to particular exploits. Once one has identified a particular exploit, all that is needed is to type the command and the location of the exploit to be used.</p>
<p>The payload is then set up using the command set payload with the following command:</p>
<pre><strong>windows/meterpreter/Name_of_payload</strong>  </pre>
<p>After this command is given, the console will request the IP address of the target and deploy the payload. Payloads are the actual attacks that the targets will be getting hit with. The following discussion will focus on a particular attack that can be used against Windows.</p>
<p>The following figure shows Metasploit running on a virtual machine trying to hack into a Windows-based computer that is also running in the virtual environment:</p>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="439" width="781" src="assets/4f352862-beac-42e8-ae94-c6f2ef4400b4.png"/></div>
<p>Another way to generate a payload is by using the <kbd>msfvenom</kbd> command line interface. Msfvenom combines msfpayload and msfencode in a single framework. In this example, we are creating a payload for Windows command shell, reverse TCP stager. This starts with the platform (<kbd>-p</kbd> windows), using the local IP address as the listen IP (<kbd>192.168.2.2</kbd>), port <kbd>45</kbd> as the <kbd>listen</kbd> port, and the executable file <kbd>dio.exe</kbd> as part of the attack:</p>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/eae0a11c-324e-4f5f-b97c-747bdaaf76fa.png"/></div>
<p>Once the payload has been created, you can distribute it using one of the methods that were mentioned previously in this chapter, including the most common: phishing emails.</p>

<p>This attack compromises the Windows login feature, allowing anyone to bypass the password prompt easily. There are a number of tools that can be used to do this. The two most common tools are Konboot and Hiren's Boot. Both of these tools are used in the same way. However, they do require a user to be physically close to the target computer. A hacker could use social engineering to get access to an organizational computer. It is even easier if the hacker is an insider threat. Insider threats are people working inside organizations that have malicious intentions; insider threats have the advantage of being exposed to the inside of an organization and therefore know where exactly to attack. The two hacking tools work in the same way. All that a hacker needs to do is to boot from a device in which they are contained, which could be a thumb drive or a DVD. They will skip the Windows authentication and take the hacker to the desktop.</p>
<p>From here, a hacker can freely install backdoors, keyloggers, and spyware, or even use the compromised machine to log in to servers remotely. They can also copy files from the compromised machine and any other machine in the network. The attack chain simply grows longer after a machine is attacked. The tools are effective against Linux systems too, but the main focus here is Windows since it has many users. These tools are available to download on hacking websites, and there is a free version for both that only attacks older versions of Windows.</p>
<p>The following figure shows the boot-up screen of the Konboot hacking tool:</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The previous topic discussed the use of tools that could bypass Windows authentication from where one could be able to do many things such as steal data. However, the free version of this tool would not be able to compromise the later versions of Windows. However, there is an even simpler and cheaper way to copy files from any Windows computer without having to bypass authentication. The Linux Live CD enables one to access all the files contained in a Windows computer <span>directly</span>. It is surprisingly easy to do this, and it is also completely free. All that is needed is for a hacker to have a copy of Ubuntu Desktop. In a similar way to the previously discussed tools, one needs to be physically close to the target computer. This is the reason why insider threats are best placed to execute this kind of attack since they already know the physical location of the ideal targets. A hacker will have to boot the target computer from a DVD or thumb drive containing a bootable image of Linux Desktop and select <span class="packt_screen">Try Ubuntu</span> instead of <span class="packt_screen">Install Ubuntu</span>. The Linux Live CD will boot into Ubuntu Desktop. Under <span class="packt_screen">Devices</span> in the home folder, all the Windows files will be listed so that a hacker can simply copy them. Unless the hard disk is encrypted, all the user files will be visible in plain text. Careless users keep text documents containing passwords on their desktops. These and any other files on the disk where Windows files reside can be accessed and/or copied by the hacker. In such a simple hack, so much can be stolen. The advantage of this method is that Windows will not have any logs of files being copied when forensics is done-something that the previously discussed tools cannot hide.</p>
<p>The following figure shows a screenshot of the Ubuntu Desktop operating system (23).</p>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="218" width="343" src="assets/028b1ef8-0467-4a98-948a-12f4089b9183.png"/></div>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>This is more of an extension of the previous compromise of the Microsoft Windows OS. This also uses the Linux Live CD to gain access to the files on a computer running on Windows. In the previous attack, the aim was just to copy data.</p>
<p>In this attack, the aim is to compromise the Windows programs. Once access has been granted via the Live CD, a hacker needs only to navigate to the Windows files and click on the <kbd>System32</kbd> folder. This is the folder in which Windows stores its own applications that normally come preinstalled. A hacker can modify some of the commonly used applications such that when the Windows user runs them, a malicious action is performed instead. This discussion will focus on the magnify tool, which is used when a user zooms into pictures, enlarging text on the screen, or in browsers. The magnify program is found in the <kbd>System32</kbd> folder with the name <kbd>magnify.exe</kbd>. Any other tool in this folder can be used to achieve the same result. One needs to delete the real magnify.exe and replace it with a malicious program renamed as magnify.exe. After this is done, the hacker can exit the system. When the Windows user opens the computer and performs an action that runs the magnify tool, the malicious program is run instead and will immediately proceed to encrypt the computer's files. The user will not know what led to the encryption of their files.</p>
<p>Alternatively, this technique can be used to attack a password-locked computer. The magnify tool could be deleted and replaced with a copy of command prompt. Here, the hacker will have to reboot and load the Windows OS. The magnify tool is normally conveniently placed such that it can be accessed without requiring a user to log in to the computer. The command prompt can be used to create users, open programs such as browsers, or to create backdoors alongside many other hacks. The hacker can also call the Windows Explorer from the command point, which at this point will load the Windows user interface logged on to a user called SYSTEM while still at the login screen. The user has privileges to change the passwords of other users, access files, and make system changes among other functions. This is generally very helpful for computers in a domain where users get privileges according to their work roles.</p>
<p>Konboot and Hiren's boot will just enable a hacker to open a user's account without authentication. This technique, on the other hand, allows a hacker to access functions that the normal user account may be forbidden from due to a lack of privileges.</p>

<p>This technique is very similar to that of Konboot and Hiren's boot when used to compromise a Windows-based computer. It, therefore, requires the hacker to access the target computer physically. This also emphasizes the use of insider threats to actualize most of these types of attacks. This technique uses a freely available tool called Ophcrack that is used to recover Windows passwords. The tool is free to download but is as effective as the premium versions of Konboot and Hiren's boot. To use it, a hacker needs to have the tools burned to a CD or copied onto a bootable USB flash drive. The target computer needs to be booted into Ophcrack in order for it to recover the password from the hashed values stored by Windows. The tool will list all the user accounts and then recover their individual passwords. Noncomplex passwords will take less than a minute to recover. This tool is surprisingly effective and can recover long and complex passwords.</p>
<p>The following figure shows Ophcrack recovering the password of one computer user:</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The previous attacks targeted local systems where the hacker needed to be physically present to hack the target device. However, hackers will not always have the luxury of being physically near the target. In some companies, there are tough measures taken to limit the people that can access some computers, and therefore insider threats might not be effective. This is why compromising systems remotely is important. To compromise remote systems, two hacking tools and one technique are necessary. The technique that a hacker must be knowledgeable about is social engineering. The previous chapter discussed social engineering in depth, and explained how a hacker can convincingly appear as someone else and successfully retrieve sensitive information.</p>
<p>The two tools that are required are the Nessus scanner (or its equivalent) and Metasploit. Using social engineering, a hacker should be able to obtain information, such as the IP addresses of valuable targets. A network scanner, such as Nessus, can then be used to scan and identify the vulnerabilities in the said valuable target. This is then followed by the use of Metasploit to compromise the target remotely. All these tools were discussed in the previous topic. There are many other scanning and exploitation tools that can be used to follow the same sequence and perform the hack.</p>
<p>An alternative to this is using the inbuilt Windows remote desktop connection feature. This, however, requires a hacker to have already compromised a machine in an organizational network. Most of the previously discussed techniques of compromising the Windows OS are applicable for the first segment of the attack; they will ensure that an attacker gains access to the remote desktop connection feature of Windows. Using information gathered from social engineering or network scanning, a hacker will know the IP addresses of servers or other valuable devices. The remote desktop connection will allow the hacker to open the target server or computer from the compromised computer. Once in the server or computer via this connection, a hacker can then perform a number of malicious actions. The hacker can create backdoors to allow subsequent logins to the target, the server can copy valuable information, and the hacker can also install malware that can spread itself over a network.</p>
<p>The discussed attacks have highlighted some of the ways in which machines can be compromised. As well as computers and servers, hackers can exploit web-based systems.</p>
<p>The following topic will discuss ways in which hackers illegally gain access to web-based systems. It will also discuss ways hackers manipulate the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of systems.</p>

<p>Almost all organizations have a web presence. Some organizations use their websites to offer services or sell products to online customers. Organizations such as schools have online portals to help them manage information and display it in several ways to different users. Hackers started targeting websites and web-based systems long ago, but back then it was just for the fun of hacking. Today, web-based systems contain highly valuable and sensitive data.</p>
<p>Hackers are after this data to steal it and sell it to other parties or hold it to ransom for huge sums of money. At times, competitors are turning to hackers to force the websites of their competitors out of service. There are several ways in which websites can be compromised. The following discussion take a look at the most common ones.</p>

<p>This is a code injection attack that targets the execution of inputs provided by users on the backend for websites coded in PHP and SQL. It might be an outdated attack, but some organizations are too careless and will hire anyone to make them a corporate website. Some organizations are even running old websites that are vulnerable to this attack. Hackers supply inputs that can manipulate the execution of SQL statements, causing a compromise to occur at the backend and expose the underlying database. SQL injections can be used to read, modify, or delete databases and their contents. To execute an SQL injection attack, a hacker needs to create a valid SQL script and enter it in any input field. Common examples include <kbd>"or "1"="1 and " or "a"="a</kbd>, which fool the SQL codes running in the backend. Essentially, what the above scripts do is end the expected query and throw in a valid statement. If it was at a login field, in the backend, developers will have coded the SQL and PHP codes to check whether the values that the user entered in the username and password fields match the ones in the database. The script <kbd>'or '1'='1</kbd> instead tells the SQL either to end the comparison or to check whether one is equal to one. A hacker can add an even more malicious code with commands such as <kbd>select</kbd> or <kbd>drop</kbd>, which may lead to the database spewing out its contents or deleting tables respectively.</p>

<p>This is an attack similar to SQL injection in that its targets use JavaScript codes. Unlike SQL injection, the attack runs at the frontend of the website and executes dynamically. It exploits the input fields of a website if they are not sanitized. XSS scripting is used by hackers to steal cookies and sessions as well as display alert boxes. There are different ways that XSS scripting can be done, namely stored XSS, Reflected XSS, and DOM-based XSS.</p>
<p>Stored XSS is a variant of XSS scripting where a hacker wants to store a malicious XSS script in the HTML of a page or in the database. This then executes when a user loads the affected page. In a forum, a hacker may register for an account with a malicious JavaScript code.</p>
<p>This code will be stored in the database, but when a user loads the forum members' web page, the XSS will execute. The other types of XSS scripting are easily caught by newer versions of browsers and have thus already become ineffective. You can view more examples of XSS attacks at <kbd><span class="URLPACKT">excess-xss.com</span></kbd>.</p>

<p>This is a common attack used in publicly shared computers, especially those in cybercafes. These attacks target machines, as websites establish sessions and store cookies on the physical computers but do not delete them when a user closes a browser without logging out. The hacker, in this case, will not have to do much to access an account other than just open the websites in a browser's history and steal information from logged-in accounts. In another variation of this type of hacking, a hacker remains observant on social media or chat forums for links that users post. Some session IDs are embedded in a browser's URL, and once a user shares a link with the ID hackers can use it to access the account and find out private information about the user.</p>

<p>These are often used against big companies. Hackers are increasingly gaining access to botnets composed of infected computers and IoT devices, as mentioned previously. Botnets are made up of computing or IoT devices that have been infected with malware to make them agents. These agents are controlled by handlers that hackers create to commandeer large numbers of bots. Handlers are the computers on the internet that bridge the communication between hackers and the agents. Owners of computers that have already been compromised and made agents might not know that they have bots:</p>

<p>To execute DDoS attacks, hackers instruct the handlers to send a command to all agents to send requests to a certain IP address. To a web server, these requests exceed its capabilities to reply and therefore it is brought down. The main aims for DDoS attacks are normally either to bring down a server or to create a diversion in order to commit another malicious act such as stealing data.</p>

<p>This chapter has gone through the many ways in which a system can be compromised. It has discussed ways in which a hacker can compromise an operating system and explained the tools that can be used to deploy payloads against a vulnerable target. It has looked at the ways in which remote systems are hacked, and has also explained common methods used to hack into web-based systems. We have also discussed the use of phishing, vulnerability exploitation, zero-day attacks, and the most common software used for compromising systems. The chapter has also given you alternatives to the tools that are discussed.</p>
<p>The next chapter will be on lateral movement and will discuss the ways hackers move around a system once they have compromised it. The chapter will talk about how the attackers find their way to other parts of the system, how they avoid detection, and will then focus on the ways hackers perform lateral movement.</p>
