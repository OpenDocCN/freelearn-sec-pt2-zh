    tools and techniques used to gather information about a target so that an attack
    can be planned and executed. It also touched on the external and internal reconnaissance
    techniques. This chapter will discuss how actual attacks are conducted after information
    about the target is collected in the reconnaissance phase. It will discuss the
    visible trends in the choice of attack tools, techniques, and targets by hackers.
    It will discuss how phishing can be crafted to carry out an actual attack, as
    well as zero-day exploits and the methods hackers use to discover them. Finally,
    the chapter will then go into a step-by-step discussion of how one can carry out
    attacks against computers, servers, and websites.

    stolen data from companies. However, in the last three years, they have been seen
    using another tactic: extorting money directly from their victims. They may either
    hold computer files to ransom or threaten to release damaging information about
    a victim to the public. In both instances, they request money to be paid before
    a certain deadline expires. One of the most famous extortion attempts is the WannaCry
    ransomware that came about in May 2017\. The WannaCry ransomware infected hundreds
    of thousands of computers in over 150 countries. From Russia to the US, whole
    organizations were brought to a halt after users were locked out of their data,
    which had been encrypted. The ransomware attempted to extort users by asking for
    $300 to be paid to a Bitcoin address within 72 hours, after which the amount would
    double. There was also a stern warning of having files locked permanently if payment
    was not made within 7 days.'

    its code. However, it had the potential to do lots of damage. Experts say that
    if the code did not include a kill switch, the ransomware would either still be
    around or would have claimed many computers. Shortly after WannaCry was mitigated,
    a new ransomware was reported. The ransomware hit computers in Ukraine, which
    were reported to be in the range of the tens of thousands. Russia was also affected,
    with computers used to monitor the Chernobyl nuclear plant being compromised,
    causing employees on-site to fall back to the noncomputerized monitoring means
    such as observation. Some companies in the US and Australia were also affected.

    of ransomware at different companies. Apart from ransomware, hackers have been
    extorting money by threatening to hack sites. The Ashley Madison incident is a
    good example of this type of extortion. After failed extortion attempts, hackers
    exposed the user data of millions of people. The owners of the website did not
    take the threats that hackers had made seriously, and therefore did not pay up
    or shut down the website as they had been ordered. Hackers actualized their threats
    when they publicly released details of users that had registered on the site.
    Some of these people had registered using work details, such as work emails. In
    July, it was confirmed that the company offered to pay a total of $11 million
    to compensate for the exposure of 36 million users. A similar extortion case faced
    a United Arab Emirates bank called Sharjah in 2015\. The hacker held the user
    data to ransom and demanded a payment of $3 millionÂ from the bank. The hacker
    periodically released some of the user data on Twitter after a number of hours.
    The bank also downplayed the threats, and even had Twitter block the account he
    had been using. This reprieve was short-lived as the hacker created a new account,
    and in an act of vengeance released the user data which contained personal details
    of the account owners, their transactions, and details of the entities that they
    had transacted with. The hacker even reached out to some of the users via text.

    preferred by hackers. Hackers are getting into systems with a goal of copying
    as much data as possible and then successfully holding it to ransom for huge amounts
    of money. Logistically, this is viewed as simpler than trying to sell off stolen
    data to third parties. Hackers are also able to negotiate for more money as the
    data they hold is more valuable to owners than it is to third parties. Extortion
    attacks such as ransomware have also become effective since there is hardly any
    decryption workaround, other than having to pay up.

    the manipulation of data instead of deleting or releasing it. This is because
    such attacks compromise the integrity of data. There is no agony that hackers
    can cause to a target that is greater than making it distrust the integrity of
    its own data. Data manipulation can be trivial, at times changing just a single
    value, but the consequences can be far-reaching. Data manipulation is often difficult
    to detect and hackers might even manipulate data in backup storage to ensure that
    there is no recovery. In one real-world example, Chinese spies have been known
    to attack US defense contractor networks to steal blueprints. It is, (22) however,
    feared that they might have also been manipulating the data used by the contractors.
    This might, in turn, sabotage the integrity of weapons supplied to the US or introduce
    changes in the ways they operate such that third parties could have a level of
    control too.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data manipulation is said to be the next stage of cybercrime, and it is anticipated
    that there will be many more cases of it in the near future. US industries have
    been said to be unprepared for these kinds of attack. Cybersecurity experts have
    been warning of imminent threats of manipulation attacks on health care, financial,
    and government data. This is because hackers have previously, and are still able
    to, steal data from industries and government institutions including the FBI.
    A slight escalation of these attacks would have greater consequences on all organizations.
    For example, for an institution such as a bank, data manipulation could be catastrophic.
    It is plausible that hackers can break into a bank system, access the database
    and make changes before proceeding to implement the same changes on the bank's
    backup storage. It may sound far-fetched, but with insider threats, this can easily
    happen. If the hackers are able to manipulate both the actual and backup databases
    to show different values as customer balances, there would be chaos. Withdrawals
    could be suspended, and it would take the bank months, or even years, to determine
    the actual customer balances.

    Not only will they cause anguish to users, they will also enable hackers to demand
    more money to return data to its correct state. It is convenient for them that
    many organizations are not paying close enough attention to the security of their
    own databases. Data manipulation attacks could also be used to provide misinformation
    to the masses. This is a problem that publicly traded companies should be worried
    about. A good example is when hackers were able to hack into the official Twitter
    account of The Associated Press and tweet a news story that the Dow had dropped
    by 150 points. The impact of this was an actual deflation of the Dow by an estimated
    $136 billion. As seen, this is an attack that can affect any company and hurt
    its profits.

    Most organizations depend on automated backups, but do not go the extra step of
    ensuring that the data stored has not been manipulated. This small act of laziness
    is easily exploitable by hackers. Predictions are that unless organizations pay
    attention to the integrity of their data, data manipulation attacks will increase

    to baby monitors. The IoT is going to see an increase in connected cars, sensors,
    medical devices, lights, houses, power grids, and monitoring cameras, among many
    other things. Since the market-wide spread of IoT devices, a few attacks have
    already been witnessed. In most of them, the attacks were aimed at commandeering
    large networks made up of these devices to execute even larger attacks. Networks
    of CCTV cameras and IoT lights have been used to cause **distributed denial of

    at generating voluminous illegitimate traffic capable of taking down the servers
    of organizations that offer online services. These will retire botnets that have
    been made of unsuspicious user computers. This is because IoT devices are easier
    to access, are already available in large numbers, and are not adequately protected.
    Experts have warned that most IoT devices are not secure and most of the blame
    has fallen on the manufacturers. In a rush to capitalize on the profits that this
    new technology has, many manufacturers of IoT productsÂ have not been prioritizing
    the security of their devices. Users, on the other hand, are lazy, and experts
    say that most users leave IoT devices with their default security configurations.
    With the world heading towards the automation of many tasks through IoT devices,
    cyberattackers will have many pawns to play around with, meaning IoT-related attacks

    found that some of its firewalls had firmware that contained backdoors installed
    by hackers. The backdoors enabled hackers to decrypt traffic flowing through the
    firewalls. It clearly meant that the hackers wanted to infiltrate organizations
    that had bought firewalls from the company. Juniper Networks said that such a
    hack could only have been actualized by a government agency with enough resources
    to handle traffic flowing in and out of many networks. The **National Security
    Agency** (**NSA**) was put in the spotlight since the backdoor had similarities
    to another one that was also attributed to the agency. Although it is unclear
    who was actually responsible for the backdoor, the incident brings up a big threat.

    compromising one of the companies in the supply chain that delivers cyber-related
    products to consumers. In the discussed incident, the backdoor was planted at
    the manufacturer's premises, and therefore any organization that bought a firewall
    from them was infiltrated by the hacker. There have been other incidents where
    backdoors have been delivered embedded in a software. Companies selling legitimate
    software on their websites have also become targets for hackers. Hackers have
    been inserting codes to create backdoors into legit software in a manner that
    the backdoor will be harder to find. It is one of the adaptations that hackers
    are having to take due to the evolution of cybersecurity products. Since these
    types of backdoor are hard to find, it is expected that they will be extensively
    used by hackers in the near future.

    **operating system** (**OS**) is Android, since it has the highest number of users
    so far. However, the OS has been making several security improvements in its architecture,
    making it more difficult for hackers to infect devices running on it. The cybersecurity
    company says that out of the total number of Android-based devices that have been
    installed, it has blocked about 18 million attacks in 2016 alone. This was double
    the number of attacks blocked in 2015, where it reported only 9 million attack
    attempts. The security company also reported that there was a rise in the growth
    of mobile malware. It is believed that these will become more prevalent in the
    future. The malware it noted was that of generated fraudulent click adverts and
    those that downloaded ransomware onto mobile phones.

    detections of malware used to steal personal information from their victims' devices.
    Since mobile device attacks are presumably doubling every year, Symantec may report
    over 30 million attack attempts in its 2017 report. The increase in mobile phone
    attacks is attributed to the low level of protection that users afford their smartphones.
    While people are willing to ensure that they have an antivirus program running
    on their computers, most smartphone users are unconcerned about attacks that hackers
    can carry out on their devices. Smartphones have browsers and web-supported apps
    that are vulnerable to scripting attacks, and they are also exploitable through
    the man-in-the-middle attack. In addition, new attacks are emerging; in September
    2017, zero-day vulnerabilities were discovered. One of these was BlueBorne, which
    can take over any Bluetooth-enabled device and infect it with malware.

    networks, which to other people, seem to be harmless and therefore are not accorded
    any type of security. These are peripherals such as printers and scanners, preferably
    those that have been assigned an IP address for the purposes of sharing. Hackers
    have been hacking into these devices, and in particular printers, since modern
    printers come with an inbuilt memory function and only basic security features.
    The most common security features include password authentication mechanisms.
    However, these basic security measures are not enough to deter motivated hackers.
    Hackers have been using printers for corporate espionage by gathering the sensitive
    data that users send to be printed. Printers have also been used as entry points
    into otherwise secure networks. Hackers can easily hack into a network using an
    unsecured printer instead of using the more difficult way of having to compromise
    a computer or server within a network.

    of its incomparable flexibility, accessibility, and capacity. However, cybersecurity
    experts have been warning that the cloud is not secure, and the increasing number
    of attacks orchestrated on the cloud has added weight to these claims. There is
    one great vulnerability in the cloud: everything is shared. People and organizations
    have to share storage space, CPU cores, and network interfaces. Therefore, it
    only requires hackers to go past the boundaries that cloud vendors have established
    to prevent people from accessing each other''s data. Since the vendor owns the
    hardware, he/she has ways to bypass these boundaries. This is what hackers are
    always counting on in order to make their way into the backend of the cloud where
    all the data resides. There is a limit to the extent to which individual organizations
    can ensure the security of the data that they store in the cloud. The security
    environment of the cloud is largely determined by the vendor. While individual
    organizations might be able to offer unbreakable security to its local servers,
    they cannot extend the same to the cloud. There are risks that arise when cybersecurity
    becomes the responsibility of another party. The vendor may not be so thorough
    with the security afforded to clients'' data. The cloud also involves the use
    of shared platforms with other people, yet a cloud user is only given limited
    access controls. Security is majorly left to the vendor.'

    not safe. In the last two years, there has been an upward growth of incidences
    of cloud vendors and companies using the cloud being attacked. Target is one of
    the organizations that has fallen victim to cloud hacks. Through phishing emails,
    hackers were able to get credentials used for the organization's cloud servers.
    Once authenticated, they were able to steal the credit card details of up to 70
    million customers. The organization is said to have been warned several times
    about the possibility of such an attack, but these warnings were overlooked. In
    2014, a year after the Target incident, Home Depot found itself in the same position
    after hackers were able to steal the details of about 56 million credit cards
    and compromise over 50 million emails belonging to clients. The hackers used a
    malware on a point of sale system in the organization. They were able to gather
    enough information to enable them to access the cloud of the organization from
    where they started stealing data. Sony Pictures was also hacked, and the attackers
    were able to obtain from the organization's cloud servers employee information,
    financial details, sensitive emails, and even unreleased films. In 2015, hackers
    were able to access details of more than 100,000 accounts from the US **Internal
    Revenue Service** (**IRS**). The details included social security numbers, dates
    of birth, and individuals' actual addresses. The said details were stolen from
    the IRS's cloud servers.

    or a system within an organization. Unlike organizational servers, it is hard
    for individuals to know when an intruder is illegally accessing data in a cloud.
    Despite their low levels of preparedness for the threats that come with the cloud,
    many organizations are still adopting it. A lot of sensitive data is being put
    at risk on cloud platforms. Hackers have therefore decided to focus on this type

    it can be the precursor to an attack or as an attack itself. As a reconnaissance
    attack, the hackers are mostly interested in getting information from users. As
    was discussed, they might disguise themselves as a trustworthy third-party organization,
    such as a bank, and simply trick users into giving out secretive information.
    They might also try to take advantage of a user''s greed, emotions, fears, obsessions,
    and carelessness. However, when phishing is used as an actual attack to compromise
    a system, the phishing emails come carrying some payloads. Hackers may use attachments

    example, users may be told that there has been a security breach in their online
    bank account and will then go to change their passwords via a certain link. The
    link might lead the user to a replica website from where all the details a user
    gives will be stolen. The email may have a link that first directs the user to
    a malicious website, installs a malware, and then almost immediately redirects
    them to the genuine website. In all of these instances, authentication information
    is stolen and is then used to fraudulently transfer money or steal files.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Buffer overflows are caused by the use of incorrect logic in the codes of a
    system. Hackers will identify areas where these overflows can be exploited in
    a system. They execute the exploit by instructing a system to write data to a
    buffer memory but not to observe the memory restrictions of the buffer. The system
    will end up writing data past the acceptable limit, which will therefore overflow
    to parts of the memory. The main aim of this type of exploit is to cause a system
    to crash in a controllable way. It is a common zero-day exploit since it is easy
    for an attacker to identify areas in a program where an overflow can happen.

    attack the logic of the SEH, causing it to correct nonexistent errors and lead

    any attack must begin with a scanning or sniffing tool that is part of the recon
    phase. Nessus can be installed in the hacker's machine using the Linux terminal
    with the command `apt-get install Nessus`. After installing Nessus, a hacker will
    create an account to log in to in order to use the tool in the future. The tool
    is then started on BackTrack and will be accessible from the local host (127.0.0.1)
    at port `8834` using any web browser. The tool requires Adobe Flash to be installed
    in the browser that it is opened in. From there, it gives a login prompt that
    will authenticate the hacker into the full functionalities of the tool.

    The tool gives a report after scanning the individual hosts that the scan was
    carried out on. It will categorize vulnerabilities into either high, medium, or
    low priority. It will also give the number of open ports that can be exploited.
    The high priority vulnerabilities are the ones that hackers will usually target
    as they easily give them information on how to exploit systems using an attack

    are used in the same way. However, they do require a user to be physically close
    to the target computer. A hacker could use social engineering to get access to
    an organizational computer. It is even easier if the hacker is an insider threat.
    Insider threats are people working inside organizations that have malicious intentions;
    insider threats have the advantage of being exposed to the inside of an organization
    and therefore know where exactly to attack. The two hacking tools work in the
    same way. All that a hacker needs to do is to boot from a device in which they

    from where one could be able to do many things such as steal data. However, the
    free version of this tool would not be able to compromise the later versions of
    Windows. However, there is an even simpler and cheaper way to copy files from
    any Windows computer without having to bypass authentication. The Linux Live CD
    enables one to access all the files contained in a Windows computerÂ directly.
    It is surprisingly easy to do this, and it is also completely free. All that is
    needed is for a hacker to have a copy of Ubuntu Desktop. In a similar way to the
    previously discussed tools, one needs to be physically close to the target computer.
    This is the reason why insider threats are best placed to execute this kind of
    attack since they already know the physical location of the ideal targets. A hacker
    will have to boot the target computer from a DVD or thumb drive containing a bootable
    image of Linux Desktop and select Try Ubuntu instead of Install Ubuntu. The Linux
    Live CD will boot into Ubuntu Desktop. Under Devices in the home folder, all the
    Windows files will be listed so that a hacker can simply copy them. Unless the
    hard disk is encrypted, all the user files will be visible in plain text. Careless
    users keep text documents containing passwords on their desktops. These and any
    other files on the disk where Windows files reside can be accessed and/or copied
    by the hacker. In such a simple hack, so much can be stolen. The advantage of
    this method is that Windows will not have any logs of files being copied when
    forensics is done-something that the previously discussed tools cannot hide.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this attack, the aim is to compromise the Windows programs. Once access has
    been granted via the Live CD, a hacker needs only to navigate to the Windows files
    and click on the `System32` folder. This is the folder in which Windows stores
    its own applications that normally come preinstalled. A hacker can modify some
    of the commonly used applications such that when the Windows user runs them, a
    malicious action is performed instead. This discussion will focus on the magnify
    tool, which is used when a user zooms into pictures, enlarging text on the screen,
    or in browsers. The magnify program is found in the `System32` folder with the
    name `magnify.exe`. Any other tool in this folder can be used to achieve the same
    result. One needs to delete the real magnify.exe and replace it with a malicious
    program renamed as magnify.exe. After this is done, the hacker can exit the system.
    When the Windows user opens the computer and performs an action that runs the
    magnify tool, the malicious program is run instead and will immediately proceed
    to encrypt the computer's files. The user will not know what led to the encryption
    of their files.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Alternatively, this technique can be used to attack a password-locked computer.
    The magnify tool could be deleted and replaced with a copy of command prompt.
    Here, the hacker will have to reboot and load the Windows OS. The magnify tool
    is normally conveniently placed such that it can be accessed without requiring
    a user to log in to the computer. The command prompt can be used to create users,
    open programs such as browsers, or to create backdoors alongside many other hacks.
    The hacker can also call the Windows Explorer from the command point, which at
    this point will load the Windows user interface logged on to a user called SYSTEM
    while still at the login screen. The user has privileges to change the passwords
    of other users, access files, and make system changes among other functions. This
    is generally very helpful for computers in a domain where users get privileges
    according to their work roles.

    threats to actualize most of these types of attacks. This technique uses a freely
    available tool called Ophcrack that is used to recover Windows passwords. The
    tool is free to download but is as effective as the premium versions of Konboot
    and Hiren's boot. To use it, a hacker needs to have the tools burned to a CD or
    copied onto a bootable USB flash drive. The target computer needs to be booted
    into Ophcrack in order for it to recover the password from the hashed values stored
    by Windows. The tool will list all the user accounts and then recover their individual
    passwords. Noncomplex passwords will take less than a minute to recover. This
    tool is surprisingly effective and can recover long and complex passwords.

    To compromise remote systems, two hacking tools and one technique are necessary.

    can then be used to scan and identify the vulnerabilities in the said valuable
    target. This is then followed by the use of Metasploit to compromise the target
    remotely. All these tools were discussed in the previous topic. There are many
    other scanning and exploitation tools that can be used to follow the same sequence
    and perform the hack.

    feature. This, however, requires a hacker to have already compromised a machine
    in an organizational network. Most of the previously discussed techniques of compromising
    the Windows OS are applicable for the first segment of the attack; they will ensure
    that an attacker gains access to the remote desktop connection feature of Windows.
    Using information gathered from social engineering or network scanning, a hacker
    will know the IP addresses of servers or other valuable devices. The remote desktop
    connection will allow the hacker to open the target server or computer from the
    compromised computer. Once in the server or computer via this connection, a hacker
    can then perform a number of malicious actions. The hacker can create backdoors
    to allow subsequent logins to the target, the server can copy valuable information,
    and the hacker can also install malware that can spread itself over a network.

    by users on the backend for websites coded in PHP and SQL. It might be an outdated
    attack, but some organizations are too careless and will hire anyone to make them
    a corporate website. Some organizations are even running old websites that are
    vulnerable to this attack. Hackers supply inputs that can manipulate the execution
    of SQL statements, causing a compromise to occur at the backend and expose the
    underlying database. SQL injections can be used to read, modify, or delete databases
    and their contents. To execute an SQL injection attack, a hacker needs to create
    a valid SQL script and enter it in any input field. Common examples include `"or
    "1"="1 and " or "a"="a`, which fool the SQL codes running in the backend. Essentially,
    what the above scripts do is end the expected query and throw in a valid statement.
    If it was at a login field, in the backend, developers will have coded the SQL
    and PHP codes to check whether the values that the user entered in the username
    and password fields match the ones in the database. The script `'or '1'='1` instead
    tells the SQL either to end the comparison or to check whether one is equal to
    one. A hacker can add an even more malicious code with commands such as `select`Â or
    `drop`, which may lead to the database spewing out its contents or deleting tables

    It has discussed ways in which a hacker can compromise an operating system and
    explained the tools that can be used to deploy payloads against a vulnerable target.
    It has looked at the ways in which remote systems are hacked, and has also explained
    common methods used to hack into web-based systems. We have also discussed the
    use of phishing, vulnerability exploitation, zero-day attacks, and the most common
    software used for compromising systems. The chapter has also given you alternatives
    to the tools that are discussed.

    move around a system once they have compromised it. The chapter will talk about
    how the attackers find their way to other parts of the system, how they avoid
    detection, and will then focus on the ways hackers perform lateral movement.
