<p>From <a href="f3d94d9a-e2b3-40cd-b625-b79bbaadcf5e.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Understanding the Cybersecurity Kill Chain</em>, to <a href="35fadac6-835f-40fb-aa4b-fdf2af68073c.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Privilege Escalation</em> we covered the attack strategies, and how the Red Team could enhance an organization's security posture by leveraging common attack techniques. Now it is time to switch gears and start looking at things from a defensive perspective. There is no other way to start talking about defense strategies other than by starting with security policies. A good set of security policies is essential to ensure that the entire company follows a well-defined set of ground rules that will help to safeguard its data and systems.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we are going to cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reviewing your security policy</li>
<li>Educating the end user</li>
<li>Policy enforcement</li>
<li>Monitoring for compliance</li>
</ul>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Reviewing your security policy</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Perhaps the first question should be—"Do you even have a security policy in place?" Even if the answer is "Yes," you still need to continue asking these questions. The next question is—"Do you enforce this policy?" Again, even if the answer is "Yes," you must follow up with—How often do you review this security policy, looking for improvements?" OK, now we've got to the point where we can safely conclude that security policy is a living document—it needs to be revised and updated.</p>
<p>Security policies should include industry standards, procedures, and guidelines, which are necessary to support information risks in daily operations. These policies must also have a well-defined scope.</p>
<p>It is imperative that the applicability of the security policy states where it applies.</p>
<p>For example, if it applies to all data and systems, this must be clear to everyone reading it. Another question that you must ask is: "Does this policy also apply to contractors?" Regardless of whether the answer is "Yes" or "No," it must be stated in the scope section of the policy.</p>
<p>The foundation of the security policy should be based on the security triad (confidentiality, integrity, and availability). Ultimately, the users are required to protect and ensure the applicability of the security triad in the data and systems, which is independent of how that data was created, shared, or stored. Users must be aware of their responsibilities, and the consequences of violating these policies. Make sure that you also include a section that specifies the roles and responsibilities, since this is very important for accountability purposes.</p>
<p>It is also important to make it clear which documents are involved in the overall security policy, since there are more than one. Make sure all users understand the difference between the following documents:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Policy</strong>: This is the basis of everything; it sets high-level expectations. It will also be used to guide decisions and achieve outcomes.</li>
<li><strong>Procedure</strong>: As the name suggests, this is a document that has procedural steps that outline how something must be done.</li>
<li><strong>Standard</strong>: This document establishes requirements that must be followed. In other words, everyone must comply with certain standards that were previously established.</li>
<li><strong>Guidelines</strong>: Although many would argue that guidelines are optional, they are in fact more additional recommended guidance. Having said that, it is important to note that each company has the freedom to define whether the guidelines are optional, or if they are recommended.</li>
<li><strong>Best practices</strong>: As the name says, these are best practices to be implemented by the entire company, or just some departments within the company. This can also be established per role—for example, all web servers should have security best practices from the vendor applied prior to being deployed in production.</li>
</ul>
<p>To make sure that all these points are synchronized, managed, and have the upper management sponsorship, you need to create an organization-wide security program. The <em>NIST 800-53</em> publication suggests the following organization security control objective relationships:</p>

</div>
<p>We would need an entire book just to discuss all the elements that are in this diagram. Therefore, we strongly recommend that you read the <em>NIST 800-53</em> publication if you want more information on these areas.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>As shown in the previous diagram, the end user's education is part of the management security control, under awareness training. Perhaps this is one of the most important pieces of the security program, because a user who is uneducated in security practices can cause tremendous damage to your organization.</p>
<p>According to <em>Symantec Internet Security Threat Report Volume 22</em>, spam campaigns are the top cause of malware infestation, and although nowadays they rely on a great range of tactics, the largest malware spamming operations are still relying on social engineering techniques.</p>
<p>In the same report, Symantec concluded that in 2016 the most common word used in major malware campaigns was "invoice." This makes total sense, since the idea is to scare the user into thinking that he or she needs to pay something, otherwise something bad will happen. This is a typical approach: to scare in order to entice the user to click on the link that will compromise the system. Another platform that is being used to launch social engineering attacks is social media. In 2015, Symantec uncovered the diet spam operation on Twitter that used hundreds of thousands of fake accounts that were impersonating legitimate accounts to build a big follower base, and with that spread false propaganda about weight-loss solutions.</p>
<p>The problem is that many users will be using their own device to access company information, also known as <strong>bring your own device</strong> (<strong>BYOD</strong>), and when they are participating in false social media campaigns like this, they are easy targets for hackers. If hackers are able to compromise the user's system, they are very close to gaining access to the company's data, since most of the time they are not isolated.</p>
<p>All these scenarios only make a stronger case for educating users against this type of attack, and any other type of social-engineering attacks, including physical approaches to social engineering.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>In an article titled <em>Social Media Impact</em>, published by the <em>ISSA Journal</em> and written by the coauthor of this book, Yuri Diogenes, many cases were examined where social media was the main tool for the social engineering attack. The security program must be in line with HR and legal requirements regarding how the company should handle social media posts, and also give guidelines to employees on how they should handle their own social media presence.</p>
<p>One of the tricky questions while defining a set of guidelines to employees on how to use social media is the definition of appropriate business behavior. Disciplinary action against employees that crosses this boundary should be very clear. In October 2017, right after the mass shooting in Las Vegas, the CBS vice president made a comment implying that "Vegas victims didn't deserve sympathy because country music fans are often Republicans." The result of this online comment was simple: She was fired for violating the company's standards of conduct. While it was important for CBS to apologize <span>rapidly </span>for her behavior and show policy enforcement by firing the employee, the company was still hurt by this person's comments.</p>
<p>With the political tensions in the world and the freedom that social media gives to individuals to externalize their thoughts, situations like this are arising every single day. In August 2017, a Florida professor was fired for tweeting that Texas deserved Hurricane Harvey after voting for Trump. This is another example of an employee using his personal Twitter account to rant online and reaping bad consequences. Often, companies base their decision for firing an employee who misbehaved online on their code of conduct. For example, if you read the <em>Outside Communications</em> section in the Google Code of Conduct, you will see how Google makes recommendations regarding public disclosure of information.</p>
<p>Another important guideline to include is how to deal with defamatory posts, as well as pornographic posts, proprietary issues, harassment, or posts that can create a hostile work environment. These are imperative for most social media guidelines, and it shows that the employer is being diligent in promoting a wealth social environment within the company.</p>

<p>Security awareness training should be delivered to all employees, and it should be constantly updated to include new attack techniques and considerations. Many companies are delivering such training online, via the company's intranet. If the training is well-crafted, rich in visual capabilities, and contains a self-assessment at the end, it can be very effective. Ideally, the security awareness training should contain:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Real-world examples</strong>: Users will more easily remember things if you show a real scenario. For example, talking about phishing emails without showing what a phishing email looks like, and how to visually identify one, won't be very effective.</li>
<li><strong>Practice</strong>: Well-written text and rich visual elements are important attributes in training materials, but you must submit the user to some practical scenarios. Let the user interact with the computer to identify spear phishing or a fake social media campaign.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of the training, all users should acknowledge that they successfully finalized the training, and that they are aware not only about the security threats and countermeasures covered in the training, but also about the consequences of not following the company's security policy.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Policy enforcement</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Once you finish building your security policy, it is time to enforce it, and this enforcement will take place by using different technologies according to the company's needs. Ideally, you will have an architecture diagram of your network to understand <span>fully </span>what the endpoints are, what servers you have, how the information flows, where the information is stored, who has and who should have data access, and the different entry points to your network.</p>
<p>Many companies fail to enforce policies <span>fully </span>because they only think of enforcing policies at endpoints and servers.</p>
<p>What about network devices? That's why you need a holistic approach to tackle every single component that is active in the network, including switches, printers, and IoT devices.</p>
<p>If your company has Microsoft Active Directory, you should leverage the <strong>Group Policy Object</strong> (<strong>GPO</strong>) to deploy your security policies. These policies should be deployed according to your company's security policy. If different departments have different needs, you can segment your deployment using <strong>organizational units</strong> (<strong>OUs</strong>), and assign policies per OU.</p>
<p>For example, if the servers that belong to the HR department require a different set of policies, you should move these servers to the HR OU and assign a custom policy to this OU.</p>
<p>If you are unsure about the current state of your security policies, you should perform an initial assessment using the PowerShell command <kbd>Get-GPOReport</kbd> to export all policies to an HTML file. Make sure that you run the following command from a domain controller:</p>
<pre><strong>PS C:&gt; Import-Module GroupPolicy</strong>
<strong>PS C:&gt; Get-GPOReport -All -ReportType HTML -Path .GPO.html</strong>  </pre>
<p>The result of this command is shown here:</p>
<div class="packt_figure">
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="451" width="877" src="assets/713f6d16-ddb0-46bd-bc14-a8f4bda6879f.jpg"/></div>
</div>
<p>It is also recommended that you perform a backup of the current configuration and make a copy of this report before making any change to the current group policies. Another tool that you can also use to perform this assessment is the policy viewer, part of the Microsoft Security Compliance Toolkit, available at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=55319">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=55319</a>:</p>

</div>
<p>The advantage of this tool is that it doesn't look only into the GPOs, but also in the correlation that a policy has with a registry's key values.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>If your organization's security policy dictates that only licensed software is allowed to run in the user's computer, you need to prevent users from running unlicensed software, and also restrict the use of licensed software that is not authorized by IT. Policy enforcement ensures that only authorized applications will run on the system.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">We recommend that you read NIST publication <em>800-167</em> for further guidance on application whitelisting. Download this guide from <a href="http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-167.pdf">http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-167.pdf</a>.</div>
<p>When planning policy enforcement for applications, you should create a list of all apps that are authorized to be used in the company. Based on this list, you should investigate the details about these apps by asking the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What's the installation path for each app?</li>
<li>What's the vendor's update policy for these apps?</li>
<li>What executable files are used by these apps?</li>
</ul>
<p>The more information you can get about the app itself, the more tangible data you will have to determine whether or not an app has been tampered with. For Windows systems, you should plan to use AppLocker and specify which applications are allowed to run on the local computer.</p>
<p>In AppLocker, there are three types of conditions to evaluate an app, which are:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Publisher</span>: This should be used if you want to create a rule that will evaluate an app that was signed by the software vendor</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Path</span>: This should be used if you want to create a rule that will evaluate the application path</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">File hash</span>: This should be used if you want to create a rule that will evaluate an app that is not signed by the software vendor</li>
</ul>
<p>These options will appear in the <span class="packt_screen">Conditions</span> page when you run the create <span class="packt_screen">Executable Rules</span> wizard:</p>
<div class="packt_figure">
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/985bb391-5277-4c98-a041-212f859caa98.png"/></div>
</div>
<p>Which option you choose will depend on your needs, but these three choices should cover the majority of the deployment scenarios. Keep in mind that, depending on which option you choose, a new set of questions will appear on the page that follows. Make sure that you read the AppLocker documentation at <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/device-security/applocker/applocker-overview">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/device-security/applocker/applocker-overview</a>.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">To whitelist apps in an Apple OS, you can use Gatekeeper (<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491">https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491</a>), and in a Linux OS you can use SELinux.</div>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>As you start planning your policy deployment and addressing which setting should be changed to better protect the computers, you are basically hardening these to reduce the attack vector. You can apply <strong>Common Configuration Enumeration</strong> (<strong>CCE</strong>) guidelines to your computers.</p>
<p>To optimize your deployment, you should also consider using security baselines. This can assist you in better managing not only the security aspect of the computer, but also its compliance with company policy. For the Windows platform, you can use the Microsoft Security Compliance Manager:</p>
<div class="packt_figure">
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="522" width="842" src="assets/b977d083-9ff0-426e-8f97-1dbaed7fb75f.png"/></div>
</div>
<p>On the left-hand pane, you have all supported versions of the operating system and some applications.</p>
<p>Let's use <span class="packt_screen">Windows Server 2012</span> as an example. Once you click on this operating system, you will bring up the different roles for this server. Using the <span class="packt_screen">WS2012 Web Server Security 1.0</span> template as an example, we have a set of 203 unique settings that are going to enhance the overall security of the server:</p>
<div class="packt_figure">
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="539" width="866" src="assets/b48ea1b5-6d1a-429b-8d8c-8c0aff0adf13.png"/></div>
</div>
<p>To see more details about each setting, you should click on the configuration name in the right-hand pane:</p>
<div class="packt_figure">
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="459" width="660" src="assets/b6a191ff-d084-4465-afb0-a5eadde147d2.png"/></div>
</div>
<p>All these settings will have the same structure—<span class="packt_screen">Description</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Additional Details</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Vulnerability</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Potential Impact</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Countermeasure</span>. These suggestions are based on the CCE, which is an industry standard for baseline security configuration. After you identify the template that is most appropriate for your server/workstation, you can deploy it via GPO.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">For hardening a Linux computer, look for the security guidance available on each distribution. For example, for Red Hat, use the security guide, available at <a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/pdf/Security_Guide/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux-6-Security_Guide-en-US.pdf">https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/pdf/Security_Guide/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux-6-Security_Guide-en-US.pdf</a>.</div>
<p>When the subject is hardening, you want to make sure you leverage all operating system capabilities to heavily the security state of the computer heavily. For Windows systems, you should consider using the <strong>Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit</strong> (<strong>EMET</strong>).</p>
<p>EMET helps to prevent attackers from gaining access to your computers by anticipating and preventing the most common techniques that attackers are using to exploit vulnerabilities in Windows-based systems. This is not only a detection tool, it actually protects by diverting, terminating, blocking, and invalidating the attacker's actions. One of the advantages of using EMET to protect computers is the ability to block new and undiscovered threats:</p>
<div class="packt_figure">
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="464" width="468" src="assets/071ec52f-7369-4250-9eb8-bf9535a8c43d.png"/></div>
</div>
<p>The <span class="packt_screen">System Status</span> section shows the security mitigations that are configured. Although the ideal scenario is to have all of them enabled, this configuration can vary according to each computer's needs. The lower part of the screen shows which processes have been EMET-enabled. In the preceding example, only one application was EMET-enabled. EMET works by injecting a DLL into the executable file's memory space, so when you configure a new process to be protected by EMET, you will need to close the application and open it again—the same applies to services.</p>
<p>To protect another application from the list, right-click on the application and click <span class="packt_screen">Configure Process</span>:</p>
<div class="packt_figure">
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/510eb6f4-cd68-41f8-808d-fcb5ddbc5ba9.png"/></div>
</div>
<p>In the <span class="packt_screen">Application Configuration</span> window, you select the mitigations that you want to enable for this application.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">For more information about EMET and the options available, download the EMET user guide at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53355">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53355</a>.</div>

<p>While enforcing policies is important to ensure that the upper management's decisions are translated into real actions towards optimizing the security state of your company, monitoring these policies for compliance is also indispensable.</p>
<p>Policies that were defined based on CCE guidelines can be easily monitored using tools, such as Azure Security Center, which not only monitor Windows VMs and computers, but also those operating with Linux software:</p>
<div class="packt_figure">
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="630" width="698" src="assets/94d86aa2-04b4-4367-aaef-461616e68b49.png"/></div>
</div>
<p>The <span class="packt_screen">OS Vulnerabilities</span> dashboard shows a comprehensive view of all security policies that are currently open in Windows and Linux systems. If you click on one specific policy, you will see more details about this policy, including the reason why it is important to mitigate this vulnerability. Note that towards the end of the page, you will have the suggested countermeasure to mitigate this particular vulnerability. Since this is based on CCE, the countermeasure is always a change in configuration in the operating system or application.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Do not confuse CCE with <strong>Common Vulnerability and Exposure</strong> (<strong>CVE</strong>), which usually requires a patch to be deployed in order to mitigate a certain vulnerability that was exposed. For more information about CVE, visit <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/">https://cve.mitre.org/</a>.</div>
<div class="packt_figure">
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="467" width="296" src="assets/9d7ef1bb-60a2-486b-9885-04a5cf8fb368.png"/></div>
</div>
<p>It is important to emphasize that Azure Security Center will not deploy the configuration for you. This is a monitoring tool, not a deployment tool, which means that you need to get the countermeasure suggestion and deploy it using other methods, such as GPO.</p>
<p>Another tool that can also be used to obtain a complete view of the security state of the computers, and identify potential noncompliance cases, is the <strong>Microsoft Operations Management Suite's</strong> (<strong>OMS's</strong>) Security and Audit Solution, in particular the <span class="packt_screen">Security Baseline Assessment</span> option, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="packt_figure">
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="370" width="457" src="assets/de6534c3-5eb1-4332-b8c2-64c51cddbbce.png"/></div>
</div>
<p>This dashboard will give you statistics based on their priority (critical, warning, and informational), as well as the type of rules that are failing (registry, security, audit, or command-based). Both tools (Azure Security Center and OMS Security) are available for Windows and Linux, for VMs in Azure or Amazon AWS, and for on-premises computers.</p>

<p>In this chapter, you learned about the importance of having a security policy and driving this policy through a security program. You understood the importance of having a clear and well-established set of social media guidelines, that give the employee an accurate view of the company's view regarding public posts, and the consequences of violating these guidelines.</p>
<p>Part of the security program includes the security awareness training, which educates the end user on security-related topics. This is a critical step to take, since the end user is always the weakest link in the security chain.</p>
<p>Later on in this chapter, you learned how companies should enforce security policies using different sets of tools. Part of this policy enforcement includes application whitelisting and hardening systems. Lastly, you learned the importance of monitoring these policies for compliance, and learned how to use tools to do this.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will continue talking about defense strategies, and this time you will learn more about network segmentation and how to use this technique to enhance your protection.</p>
