    *Privilege Escalation* we covered the attack strategies, and how the Red Team
    could enhance an organization's security posture by leveraging common attack techniques.
    Now it is time to switch gears and start looking at things from a defensive perspective.
    There is no other way to start talking about defense strategies other than by
    starting with security policies. A good set of security policies is essential
    to ensure that the entire company follows a well-defined set of ground rules that
    will help to safeguard its data and systems.

    The next question is—"Do you enforce this policy?" Again, even if the answer is
    "Yes," you must follow up with—How often do you review this security policy, looking

    on how to use social media is the definition of appropriate business behavior.
    Disciplinary action against employees that crosses this boundary should be very
    clear. In October 2017, right after the mass shooting in Las Vegas, the CBS vice
    president made a comment implying that "Vegas victims didn''t deserve sympathy
    because country music fans are often Republicans." The result of this online comment
    was simple: She was fired for violating the company''s standards of conduct. While

    of an employee using his personal Twitter account to rant online and reaping bad
    consequences. Often, companies base their decision for firing an employee who
    misbehaved online on their code of conduct. For example, if you read the *Outside
