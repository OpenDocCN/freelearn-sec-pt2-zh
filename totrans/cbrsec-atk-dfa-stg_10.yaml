    of having a strong and effective security policy. Now it's time to continue with
    this vision by ensuring that the network infrastructure is secure, and the first
    step to doing that is to make sure the network is segmented, isolated and that
    it provides mechanisms to mitigate intrusion. The Blue Team must be fully aware
    of the different aspects of network segmentation, from the physical to the virtual,
    and remote access. Even if companies are not fully cloud-based, they still need
    to think about connectivity with the cloud in a hybrid scenario, which means that
    security controls must also be in place to enhance the overall security of the
    environment, and network infrastructure security is the foundation for that.

    today's demands, the reality is that it still does, although you won't be using
    the same technologies that you used in the past. The whole idea behind the defense
    in depth approach is to ensure that you have multiple layers of protection, and
    that each layer will have its own set of security controls, which will end up
    delaying the attack, and that the sensors available in each layer will alert you
    to whether or not something is happening. In other words, breaking the attack
    kill chain before the mission is fully executed.

    layers of protection within the infrastructure and services realm. Other layers

    controls on-premises, now you need to re-evaluate the inclusion of cloud connectivity
    on-premises. By creating a hybrid environment, you will need to revalidate the
    threats, the potential entry points, and how these entry points could be exploited.
    The result of this exercise is usually the conclusion that other security controls
    must be put in place.

- en: One of the biggest challenges that the Blue Team may face when dealing with
    network segmentation is getting an accurate view of what is currently implemented
    in the network. This happens because, most of the time, the network will grow
    according to the demand, and its security features are not revisited as the network
    expands. For large corporations, this means rethinking the entire network, and
    possibly rearchitecting the network from the ground up.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first step to establishing an appropriate physical network segmentation
    is to understand the logical distribution of resources according to your company's
    needs. This debunks the myth that one size fits all, which in reality, it doesn't.
    You must analyze each network case by case, and plan your network segmentation
    according to the resource demand and logical access. For small-and medium-sized
    organizations, it might be easier to aggregate resources according to their departments—for
    example, resources that belong to the financial department, human resources, operations,
    and so on. If that's the case, you could create a **virtual local area network**
    (**VLAN**) per department and isolate the resources per department. This isolation
    would improve performance and overall security.

    Let''s use the file server as an example. Most departments will need access to
    the file server at some point, which means they will have to cross VLANs to gain
    access to the resource. Cross-VLAN access will require multiple rules, different
    access conditions, and more maintenance. For this reason, large networks usually
    avoid this approach, but if it fits with your organization''s needs, you can use
    it. Some other ways to aggregate resources can be based on the following aspects:'

    that have VLAN capability, connected to a central router that will perform the
    routing control over these VLANs. Ideally, this switch will have security features
    available that restrict IP traffic from untrusted layer 2 ports, which is a feature
    known as port security. This router includes a control access list to make sure
    that only authorized traffic is able to cross these VLANs. If your organization
    requires deeper inspection across VLANS, you could also use a firewall to perform
    this routing and inspection. Note that segmentation across VLANs is done using
    different approaches, which is completely fine, as long as you plan the current
    state and how this will expand in the future.

- en: In this chapter, you learned about the current needs of using a defense in depth
    approach, and how this old method should be used to protect against current threats.
    You learned about the different layers of protection and how to increase the security
    of each layer. Physical network segmentation was the next topic covered, and here
    you learned about the importance of having a segmented network and how to correctly
    plan to implement that. You learned that network segmentation is not exclusively
    for on-premises resources, but also for remote users and remote offices. You also
    learned how it can be challenging for the Blue Team to plan and design this solution
    without accurately knowing the current network topology, and to address this problem,
    you learned about some tools that can be used during this discovery process. Lastly,
    you learned the importance of segmenting virtual networks and monitoring hybrid
    cloud connectivity.

    time, you will learn more about the sensors that should be implemented to actively
    monitor your resources and quickly identify potential threats.
