<p class="chapter-content"><span>Now that your network is segmented, you need to actively monitor to detect suspicious activities and threats, and take actions based on that.

<p>The current threat landscape demands a new approach to detection systems, relying on the traditional complexity to fine-tuning initial rules, thresholds, baselines and still deal with lots of false positives is becoming unacceptable for many organizations. When preparing to defend against attackers, the Blue Team must leverage a series of techniques that include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data correlation from multiple data sources</li>
<li>Profiling</li>
<li>Behavior analytics</li>
<li>Anomaly detection</li>
<li>Activity evaluation</li>
<li>Machine learning</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to emphasize that some of the traditional security controls, such as protocol analysis and signature-based antimalware, still have their space in the line of defense, but to combat legacy threats. You shouldn't uninstall your anti-malware software just because it doesn't have machine learning capability, it is still one level of protection to your host. Remember the defense in depth approach that we discussed in the last chapter? Think of this protection as one layer of defense, and now you need to aggregate the other layers to enhance your security posture.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the traditional defender mindset that focuses on monitoring only high profile users is over and you can't have this approach anymore. Current threat detections must look across all user accounts, profile them, and understand their normal behavior. Current threat actors will be looking to compromise the regular user, stay dormant in the network, continue the invasion by moving laterally, and escalate privileges. For this reason, the Blue Team must have detection mechanisms in place that can identify these behaviors across all devices, locations, and raise alerts based on the <strong>Data Correlation</strong>, as shown in the following diagram:</p>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="376" width="360" src="assets/22ccaa38-e0f5-4462-9185-a98c6188d30d.png"/></div>
<p>When you contextualize the data, you naturally reduce the amount of false positives, and give a more meaningful result to the investigator.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>When talking about detection, it is important to talk about <strong>Indicators of Compromise</strong> (<strong>IoC</strong>). When new threats are found in the wild, they usually have a pattern of behavior and they leave their footprint in the target system.</p>
<p>For example, Petya ransomware ran the following commands in the target system to reschedule a restart:</p>
<pre>    <strong>schtasks /Create /SC once /TN "" /TR "&lt;system folder&gt;shutdown.exe /r /f" /ST &lt;time&gt;</strong>
    <strong>cmd.exe /c schtasks /RU "SYSTEM" /Create /SC once /TN "" /TR "C:Windowssystem32shutdown.exe /r /f" /ST &lt;time&gt;</strong>
  </pre>
<p>Another Petya IoC is the local network scan on ports TCP <kbd>139</kbd> and TCP <kbd>445</kbd>. These are important indications that there is an attack taking place on the target system and, based on this footprint, Petya is the one to blame. Detection systems will be able to gather these indicators of compromise and raise alerts when an attack happens. Using Azure Security Center as an example, some hours after the Petya outbreak, Security Center automatically updates its detection engine and was able to warn users that their machine was compromised, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="346" width="383" src="assets/f1c3b520-6845-4868-80c5-980c64effdcb.png"/></div>
<p>You can sign up with OpenIOC (<a href="http://openioc.org"><span class="URLPACKT">http://openioc.org</span></a>) to retrieve information regarding new IoC and also contribute to the community. By using their IoC Editor (consult the reference section for the URL to download this tool), you can create your own IoC or you can review an existing IoC. The example that follows shows the IoC Editor showing the <span class="packt_screen">DUQU</span> Trojan IoC:</p>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/a8ed021e-cfce-400d-b484-91a470057cd1.png"/></div>
<p>If you look in the right lower pane, you will see all the indications of compromise, and logic operators (in this case most are <span class="packt_screen">AND</span>) that compare each sequence and only return positive if everything is true. The Blue Team should always be aware of the latest threats, and IoC.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">You can use the following PowerShell command to download an IoC from OpenIOC, for the example below you are downloading the IoC for Zeus threat: <kbd>wget "http://openioc.org/iocs/72669174-dd77-4a4e-82ed-99a96784f36e.ioc" -outfile "72669174-dd77-4a4e-82ed-99a96784f36e.ioc"</kbd></div>

<p>As the name implies, an <strong>intrusion detection system</strong> (<strong>IDS</strong>) is responsible for detecting a potential intrusion and trigger an alert. What can be done with this alert depends on the IDS policy. When creating an IDS Policy you need to answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who should be monitoring the IDS?</li>
<li>Who should have administrative access to the IDS?</li>
<li>How incidents will be handled based on the alerts generated by the IDS?</li>
<li>What's the IDS update policy?</li>
<li>Where should we install the IDS?</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just some examples of initial questions that should help in planning the IDS adoption. When searching for IDS, you can also consult a list of vendors at ICSA Labs Certified Products (<a href="http://www.icsalabs.com"><span class="URLPACKT">www.icsalabs.com</span></a>) for more vendor-specific information. Regardless of the brand, a typical <strong>IDS</strong> has the capabilities shown in the following diagram:</p>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="330" width="511" src="assets/5330d5c0-bee9-495e-9163-3cc06be2d846.png"/></div>
<p>While these are some core capabilities, the amount of features will really vary according to the vendor and the method used by the IDS. The signature-based IDS will query a database of previous attack's signatures (footprints) and known system vulnerabilities to verify what was identified is a threat and if an alert must be triggered. Since this is a database of signatures, it requires constant update in order to have the latest version. The behavior-based IDS works by creating a baseline of patterns based on what it learned from the system. Once it learns the normal behavior, it becomes easier to identify deviations from normal activity.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">An IDS alert is any type of user notification to bring awareness about a potential intrusion activity.</div>
<p>IDS can be host-based, as known as host-based intrusion detection system (<strong>HIDS</strong>), where the IDS mechanism will only detect an intrusion's attempt against a particular host, or it can be a <strong>network-based intrusion detection</strong><span><strong> system</strong></span> (<strong>NIDS</strong>), where it detects intrusion for the network segment that the NIDS is installed. This means that in the NIDS case, the placement becomes critical in order to gather valuable traffic. This is where the Blue Team should work closely with the IT Infrastructure team to ensure that the IDS is installed in strategic places across the network. Prioritize the following network segments when planning the NIDS placement:</p>
<ul>
<li>DMZ/Perimeter</li>
<li>Core corporate network</li>
<li>Wireless network</li>
<li>Virtualization network</li>
<li>Other critical network segments</li>
</ul>
<p>These sensors will be listening to the traffic, which means it won't be consuming too much network bandwidth.</p>
<p>The diagram that follows has an example of where to put the <strong>IDS</strong>:</p>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="412" width="523" src="assets/5d39db15-0fca-4448-ae29-b153e587ec81.png"/></div>
<p>Notice that, in this case, an <strong>IDS</strong> (which in reality here is a NIDS) was added to each segment (leveraging a SPAN port on the network switch). Is it always like that? Absolutely not! It will vary according to your company's needs. The Blue Team must be aware of the company's constraints and help identify the best location where these devices should be installed.</p>

<p>An <strong>intrusion prevention system</strong> (<strong>IPS</strong>) uses the same concept of an IDS, but, as the name says, it prevents the intrusion by taking a corrective action. This action will be customized by the IPS administrator in partnership with the Blue Team.</p>
<p>The same way IDS is available for hosts (HIDS) and network (NIDS), IPS is also available for both as HIPS and NIPS. The NIPS placement within your network is critical and the same guidelines that were previously mentioned, are applicable here. You should also consider placing the NIPS inline with traffic in order to be able to take corrective actions. IPS detection can usually operate in one or more of the following modes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rule-based</li>
<li>Anomaly-based</li>
</ul>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Rule-based detection</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>While operating this mode, the IPS will compare the traffic with a set of rules and try to verify if the traffic matches the rule. This is very useful when you need to deploy a new rule to block an attempt to exploit a vulnerability. NIPS systems, such as <strong>Snort</strong>, are able to block threats by leveraging rule-based detection. For example, the Snort rule Sid <kbd>1-42329</kbd> is able to detect the <kbd>Win.Trojan.Doublepulsar</kbd> variant.</p>
<p>Snort rules are located under <kbd>etc/snort/rules</kbd> and you can download other rules from <a href="https://www.snort.org/downloads/#rule-downloads"><span class="URLPACKT">https://www.snort.org/downloads/#rule-downloads</span></a>. When the Blue Team is going through an exercise with the Red Team, chances are that new rules must be created according to the traffic pattern and the attempts that the Red Team is making to infiltrate the system. Sometimes you need multiple rules to mitigate a threat, for example, the rules <kbd>42340</kbd> (Microsoft Windows SMB anonymous session IPC share access attempt), <kbd>41978</kbd> (Microsoft Windows SMB remote code execution attempt), and <kbd>42329-42332</kbd> (<kbd>Win.Trojan.Doublepulsar</kbd> variant) can be used to detect WannaCry ransomware. The same applies for other IPS, such as Cisco IPS that has signatures <kbd>7958/0</kbd> and <kbd>7958/1</kbd>, created to handle WannaCry.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Subscribe to the Snort blog to receive updates regarding new rules at <a href="http://blog.snort.org"><span class="URLPACKT">http://blog.snort.org</span></a>.</div>
<p>The advantage of using an open source NIPS, such as Snort, is that when a new threat is available in the wild, the community usually responds pretty fast with with a new rule to detect the threat. For example, when Petya ransomware was detected, the community created a rule, and posted at GitHub (you can see this rule here <a href="https://goo.gl/mLtnFM"><span class="URLPACKT">https://goo.gl/mLtnFM</span></a>). Although vendors and the security community are really fast to publish new rules, the Blue Team should be watching for new IoCs, and create NIPS rules based on these IoCs.</p>

<p>The anomaly, in this case, is based on what the IPS categorize as anomalous, this classification is usually based on heuristics or a set of rules. One variation of this is called statistical anomaly detection, which takes samples of network traffic at random times, and performs a comparison with a baseline. If this sample fits outside of the baseline, an action is taken (alert followed by action).</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Behavior analytics on-premises</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>For the vast majority of the companies currently in the market, the core business still happens on-premises. There is where the critical data is located, the majority of the users are working, and the key assets are located. As you know, we covered attack strategies in the first part of this book; the attacker tends to silently infiltrate your on-premises network, move laterally, escalate privilege, and maintain connectivity with command and control until he is able to execute his mission. For this reason, having behavior analytics on-premises is imperative to quickly break the attack kill chain.<br/>
According to Gartner, it is primordial to understand how users behave, and by tracking legitimate processes, organizations can enlist <strong>User and Entity Behavior Analytics</strong> (<strong>UEBA</strong>) to spot security breaches. There are many advantages in using an UEBA to detect attacks, but one of the most important ones is the capability to detect attacks in the early stages and take corrective action to contain the attack.</p>
<p>The following diagram shows an example of how <strong>UEBA</strong> looks across different entities in order to take a decision if an alert must be triggered or not:</p>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="224" width="447" src="assets/5ee46226-827a-4cb2-a4b7-4b6deedd2249.png"/></div>
<p>Without having a system that can look broadly to all data and make correlations not only on the traffic pattern, but also on a user's profile, the chances of having a false positive increase. What happens nowadays is when you use your credit card in a place that you ahve never been before and in a geographic location that you don't constantly go. If your credit card has monitoring protection, someone will call you to validate that transaction; this happens because the system understands your credit card usage pattern, it knows the places that you visited before, the locations that you bought, and even an average of what you usually spend. When you deviate from all these patterns that are interconnected, the system triggers an alert and the action that is taken is to have someone call you to double check if this is really you doing that transaction. Notice that in this scenario, you are acting quickly in the early stage, because the credit card company put that transaction on hold until they get your validation.</p>
<p>The same thing happens when you have an UEBA system on premises. The system knows what servers your users usually access, what shares they usually visit, what operating system they usually use to access these resources, and the user's geo-location. The following figure shows an example of this type of detection coming from Microsoft <strong>Advanced Threat Analytics</strong> (<strong>ATA</strong>), which uses behavior analytics to detect suspicious behavior:</p>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="366" width="556" src="assets/3319109c-9711-4a91-a92a-4fd025a8502e.png"/></div>
<p>Notice that, in this case, the message is pretty clear, it says that the <span class="packt_screen">Administrator</span> didn't perform these activities in the last month and not in correlation with other accounts within the organization. This alert is not something that can be ignored, because it is contextualized, which means it looks to the data that was collected in different angles to create a correlation and make a decision if an alert should be raised or not.</p>
<p>Having a UEBA system on-premises can help the Blue Team to be more proactive, and have more tangible data to accurately react. The UEBA system is composed of multiple modules and another module is the advanced threat detection, which looks for known vulnerabilities and attack patterns. The following figure shows Microsoft ATA detecting a pass-the-ticket attack:</p>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/030c2343-bf7c-435f-b28e-577934684727.png"/></div>
<p>Since there are different ways to perform this attack, advanced threat detection can't look just for the signature, it needs to look for the attack pattern and what the attacker is trying to do; this is way more powerful than using a signature-based system. It also looks for suspicious behavior coming from regular users that are not supposed to be doing certain tasks, for example if a regular user tries to run <kbd>NetSess.exe</kbd> tool against the local domain, Microsoft ATA will consider this a SMB session enumeration, which from the attacker's perspective, is usually done during the reconnaissance phase. For this reason, an alert is raised as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/80ca1ed5-2677-4463-946e-e3ce2b7721ec.png"/></div>
<p>Attackers will not only exploit vulnerabilities, but also take advantage of misconfigurations in the target system, such as bad protocol implementation and lack of hardening. For this reason, the UEBA system will also detect systems that are lacking a secure configuration.</p>
<p>The following example shows Microsoft <span>Advanced Threat Analytics</span> detecting a service that is exposing account credentials because it is using <span class="packt_screen">LDAP</span> without encryption:</p>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/2a3a1a4b-2261-43ab-9e85-0f766b88d8ad.png"/></div>

<p>Using the same principles that were previously discussed in the IDS section, the location where you will install your UEBA will vary according to the company's needs and the vendor's requirements. The Microsoft ATA that was used in the examples explained in the previous section requires that you use port mirroring with the domain controller (DC). ATA will have no impact in the network bandwidth since it will be only listening to the DC traffic. Other solutions might require a different approach; for this reason, it is important to plan according to the solution that you purchased for your environment.</p>

<p>When the Blue Team needs to create countermeasures to secure a hybrid environment, the team needs to expand their view of the current threat landscape, and perform an assessment in order to validate continuous connectivity with the cloud and check the impact on overall security posture. In a hybrid cloud, most companies will opt to use an IaaS model and, although IaaS adoption is growing, the security aspect of it is still the main concern, according to an Oracle survey on IaaS Adoption. According to the same report, <em>longer term IaaS users suggest the technology ultimately makes a positive impact on security</em>. In reality, it does have a positive impact and that's where the Blue Team should focus their efforts on improving their overall detection. The intent is to leverage hybrid cloud capabilities to benefit the overall security posture. The first step is to establish a good partnership with your cloud provider and understand what security capabilities they have, and how these security capabilities can be used in a hybrid environment. This is important, because some capabilities are only available in the cloud, and not on-premises.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Azure Security Center</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The reason we are using Azure Security Center to monitor hybrid environment is because the Security Center agent can be installed on a computer (Windows or Linux) on-premises, in a VM running in Azure, or in AWS. This flexibility is important and centralized management is important for the Blue Team. Security Center leverages security intelligence and advanced analytics to detect threats more quickly and reduce false positives. In an ideal scenario, the Blue Team will use a single pane of glass to visualize alerts and suspicious activities across all workloads. The core topology looks similar to the one shown in the following figure:</p>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="419" width="498" src="assets/645a3263-3ca9-4faf-9058-8c3df96bb48e.png"/></div>
<p>When the Security Center is installed on these computers, it will collect <strong>Event Tracing for Windows</strong> (<strong>ETW</strong>) traces, operating system log events, running processes, machine name, IP addresses, and logged in users. These events are sent to Azure, and stored in your private workspace storage. Security Center will analyze this data using the following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Threat intelligence</li>
<li>Behavioral analytics</li>
<li>Anomaly detection</li>
</ul>
<p>Once this data is evaluated, Security Center will trigger an alert based on priority and add in the dashboard, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/dd5f2aab-62db-425f-942d-94820ca2fe12.png"/></div>
<p>Notice that the first alert has a different icon and it is called <span class="packt_screen">Security incident detected</span>. This happens because it was identified and two or more attacks are part of the same attack campaign against a specific resource. This means that, instead of having someone from the Blue Team to scavenge the data to find correlation between events, Security Center does that automatically and provides the relevant alerts for you to analyze. When you click on this alert, you will see the following page:</p>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="448" width="525" src="assets/9f1a0533-a5a3-4bd5-89f6-c1dd341b7290.png"/></div>
<p>At the bottom of this page, you can see all three attacks (in order of occurrence) that took place against <span class="packt_screen">VM1</span> and the severity level assigned by Security Center. One important observation about the advantage of using behavior analytics to detect threats, is the third alert (<span class="packt_screen">Multiple Domain Accounts Queried</span>). The command that was executed to raise this alert was a simple <kbd><em>net user &lt;username&gt; /domain</em></kbd>; however, to make the decision that this is a suspicious, it needs to look at the normal behavior for the user that executed this command and cross-reference this information with other data that when analyzed in context, will be categorized as suspicious. As you can see in this example, hackers are leveraging built-in system tools and native command line interface to perform their attack; for this reason, it is paramount to have a command line logging tool.</p>
<p>Security Center will also use statistical profiling to build historical baselines and alert on deviations that conform to a potential attack vector. This is useful in many scenarios; one typical example is deviations from normal activity. For example, let's say a host starts RDP connections three times a day, but in a certain day there are one hundred connections attempted. When such deviation happens, an alert must be triggered to warn you about that.</p>
<p>Another important aspect of working with a cloud based service is the built in integration with other vendors. Security Center can integrate with many other solutions, such as Barracuda, F5, Imperva, and Fortinet for <strong>web application firewall</strong> (<strong>WAF</strong>), among others for endpoint protection, vulnerability assessment, and next-generation firewall. The image below shows an example of this integration. Notice that this alert was generated by <span class="packt_screen">Deep Security Agent</span> and, since it is integrated with Security Center, it will appear in the same dashboard as the other events that were detected by Security Center:</p>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="523" width="410" src="assets/5f56addf-ea33-449b-805f-b25d01e8d4ba.png"/></div>
<p>Keep in mind that Security Center is not the only solution that will monitor systems and integrate with other vendors; there are many <strong>Security Information and Event Management</strong> (<strong>SIEM</strong>) solutions, such as <strong>Splunk</strong> and <strong>LogRhythm</strong>, that will perform similar type of monitoring.</p>

<p>In this chapter, you learned about the different types of detection mechanisms and the advantages of using them to enhance your defense strategy. You learned about the indications of compromise and how to query current threats. You also learned about IDS, how it works, the different types of IDS, and the best location to install IDS based on your network. Next, you learned about the benefits of using an IPS, how rule-based and how anomaly-based detection works. The defense strategy wouldn't be completed without a good behavior analytics and, in this section, you learned how the Blue Team can benefit from this capability. Microsoft ATA was used as the on-premises example for this implementation and Azure Security Center was used as the hybrid solution for behavior analytics.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will continue talking about defense strategies; this time, you will learn more about threat intelligence and how the Blue Team can take advantage of threat intel to enhance the overall security of the defense systems.</p>
