<p>The previous chapter looked at how an attack can be investigated to understand the cause and prevent a similar attack in the future. However, an organization cannot fully depend on protecting itself from attacks and all the risks that it faces. The organization is exposed to a wide range of disasters such that it is impossible to have protective measures against them. The causes of a disaster to the IT infrastructure can either be natural or man-made. Natural disasters are ones that result from environmental hazards or acts of nature. These include blizzards, wildfires, hurricanes, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, floods, lightning strikes, and even asteroids falling from the sky and impacting the ground. Man-made disasters are ones that arise from the actions of human users or external human actors. They include fires, cyber warfare, nuclear explosions, hacking, power surges, and accidents, among others.</p>
<p>When these strike an organization, its level of preparedness to respond to a disaster will determine its survivability and speed of recovery. This chapter will look at the ways an organization can prepare for a disaster, survive it when it happens, and easily recover from the impact.</p>
<p>We will talk about the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disaster recovery plan</li>
<li>Live recovery</li>
<li>Contingency plan</li>
<li>Best practices for recovery</li>
</ul>

<p>The disaster recovery plan is a documented set of processes and procedures that are carried out in the effort to recover the IT infrastructure in the event of a disaster. Because of many organizations' dependency on IT, it has become mandatory for organizations to have a comprehensive and well-formulated disaster recovery plan. Organizations are not able to avoid all disasters; the best they can do is plan ahead how they will recover when disasters happen. The objective of the plan is to protect the continuity of business operations when IT operations have been partially or fully stopped. There are several benefits of having a sound disaster recovery plan:</p>
<ul>
<li>The organization has a sense of security. The recovery plan assures it of its continued ability to function in the face of a disaster.</li>
<li>The organization reduces delays in the recovery process. Without a sound plan, it is easy for the disaster recovery process to be done in an uncoordinated way, thereby leading to needless delays.</li>
<li>There is guaranteed reliability of standby systems. A part of the disaster recovery plan is to restore business operations using standby systems. The plan ensures that these systems are always prepped and ready to take over during disasters.</li>
<li>The provision of a standard test plan for all business operations.</li>
<li>The minimization of the time taken to make decisions during disasters.</li>
<li>The mitigation of legal liabilities that the organization could develop during a disaster.</li>
</ul>

<p>A <strong>disaster recovery</strong> (<strong>DR</strong>) team is the team that is mandated with assisting the organization with all the disaster recovery operations. It should be all-inclusive, involving members from all departments and some representatives from top-level management. This team will be key in determining the scope of the recovery plan regarding the operations that they carry out in their individual departments. The team will also oversee the successful development and implementation of the plan.</p>

<p>The disaster recovery team should conduct a risk assessment and identify the natural and man-made risks that could affect organizational operations, especially those tied to the IT infrastructure. The selected departmental staff should analyze their functional areas for all the potential risks and determine the potential consequences associated with such risks. The disaster recovery team should also evaluate the security of sensitive files and servers by listing the threats that they are exposed to and the impacts those threats may have. At the end of the risk assessment exercise, the organization should be fully aware of the impacts and consequences of multiple disaster scenarios. A thorough disaster recovery plan will be made in consideration of the worst-case scenario.</p>

<p>Here, the representatives from each department in the disaster recovery plan identify their critical needs that need to be prioritized in the event of a disaster. Most organizations will not possess sufficient resources to respond to all the needs that arise during disasters (2). This is the reason why some criteria need to be set in order to determine which needs require the organization's resources and attention first. The key areas that need to be prioritized in the making of a disaster recovery plan include functional operations, information flow, accessibility and availability of the computer systems used, sensitive data, and existing policies (2).To come up with the most important priorities, the team needs to determine the maximum possible time that each department can operate without critical systems. Critical systems are defined as systems that are required to support the different operations that take place in an organization. A common approach to establishing priorities is to list the critical needs of each department, identify the key processes that need to take place in order to meet them, and then identify and rank the underlying processes and operations. The operations and processes can be ranked into three levels of priority: essential, important, and nonessential.</p>

<p>The practical ways to recover from a disaster are identified and evaluated at this step. The recovery strategies need to be formulated to cover all aspects of the organization. These aspects include hardware, software, databases, communication channels, customer services, and end-user systems. At times, there may be written agreements with third parties, such as vendors, to provide recovery alternatives in times of disasters. The organization should review such agreements, the duration of their cover, and their terms and conditions. By the end of this step, the disaster recovery team should have a solution to all that may be affected by a disaster in the organization.</p>

<p>To facilitate the DR team going through a complete disaster recovery process, information about the organization should be collected and documented. The relevant information that should be collected includes inventory forms, policies and procedures, communication links, important contact details, customer care numbers of service providers, and details of the hardware and software resources that the organization has (3). Information about backup storage sites and backup schedules alongside their retention duration should also be collected.</p>

<p>The preceding steps, if performed correctly, will give the DR team enough information to make a sound disaster recovery plan that is both comprehensive and practical. The plan should be in a standard format that is easily readable and succinctly puts together all the essential information. The response procedures should be fully explained in an easy-to-understand manner. It should have a step-by-step layout and cover all that the response team and other users need to do when disaster strikes. The plan should also specify its own review and updating procedure.</p>

<p>The applicability and reliability of the plan should never be left to chance since it may determine the continuity of an organization after a major disaster has occurred. It should, therefore, be thoroughly tested to identify any challenges or errors that it may contain. Testing will provide a platform for the DR team and the users to perform the necessary checks and gain a good understanding of the response plan. Some of the tests that can be carried include simulations, checklist tests, full-interruption tests, and parallel tests. It is imperative that the disaster recovery plan that a whole organization will rely on is proven to be practical and effective, for both the end users and the DR team.</p>

<p>After the plan has been tested and found to be reliable, practical, and comprehensive, it should be submitted to top management to get approved.</p>
<p>The top management has to approve the recovery plan on two grounds:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first one is the assurance that the plan is consistent with the organization's policies, procedures, and other contingency plans (3). </li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 120px">An organization may have multiple business contingency plans and they should all be streamlined. For instance, a DR plan that can only bring back online services after a few weeks might be incompatible with the goals of an e-commerce company.</p>
<ul>
<li>The second grounds for approval of the plan is that the plan can be slotted in for annual reviews. </li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 120px">The top management will do its own evaluations of the plan to determine its adequacy. It is in the interests of the management that the whole organization is covered with an adequate recovery plan. The top management also has to evaluate the compatibility of the plan with the organization's goals.</p>

<p>The IT threat landscape can change a lot within a very short space of time. In previous chapters, we discussed ransomware called WannaCry, and explained that it hit over 150 countries within a short time span. It caused huge losses in terms of money and even led to deaths when it encrypted computers used for sensitive functions. This is one of the many dynamic changes that affect IT infrastructures and force organizations to quickly adapt. Therefore, a good disaster recovery plan must be updated often (3). Most of the organizations hit by WannaCry were unprepared for it and had no idea what actions  they should have taken. The attack only lasted a few days, but caught many organizations unaware. This clearly shows that disaster recovery plans should be updated based on need rather than on a rigid schedule. Therefore, the last step in the disaster recovery process should be the setting up of an updating schedule. This schedule should also make provisions for updates to be done when they are needed, too.</p>

<p>There are many challenges that face disaster recovery plans. One of these is the lack of approval by the top management. Disaster recovery planning is taken as a mere drill for a fake event that might never happen (3).</p>
<p>Therefore, the top management may not prioritize the making of such a plan and might also not approve an ambitious plan that seems to be a little bit costly. Another challenge is the incompleteness of the <strong>recovery time objective</strong> (<strong>RTO</strong>) that DR teams come up with. RTOs are the key determiners of the maximum acceptable downtime for an organization. It is at times difficult for the DR team to come up with a cost-effective plan that is within the RTO. Lastly, there is the challenge of outdated plans. The IT infrastructure dynamically changes in its attempts to counter the threats that it faces. Therefore, it is a huge task to keep the disaster recovery plan updated, and some organizations fail to do this. Outdated plans may be ineffective and may be unable to recover the organization when disasters caused by new threat vectors happen.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>There are times when a disaster will affect a system that is still in use. Traditional recovery mechanisms mean that the affected system has to be taken offline, some backup files are installed, and then the system is brought back online. There are some organizations that have systems that cannot enjoy the luxury of being taken offline for recovery to be done. There are other systems that are structurally built in a way that they cannot be brought down for recovery. In both instances, a live recovery has to be done. A live recovery can be done in two ways. The first involves a clean system with the right configurations and uncorrupted backup files being installed on top of the faulty system. The end result is that the faulty system is gotten rid of, together with its files, and a new one takes over.</p>
<p>The second type of live recovery is where data recovery tools are used on a system that is still online. The recovery tools may run an update on all the existing configurations to change them to the right ones. It may also replace faulty files with recent backups. This type of recovery is used when there is some valuable data that is to be recovered in the existing system. It allows for the system to be changed without affecting the underlying files. It also allows recovery to be done without doing a complete system restore. A good example is the recovery of Windows using a Linux live CD. The live CD can do many recovery processes, thereby saving the user from having to install a new version of Windows and thus losing all the existing programs (4). The live CD can, for instance, be used to reset or change a Windows PC password. The Linux tool used to reset or change passwords is called <kbd>chntpw</kbd>. An attacker does not need any root privileges to perform this. The user needs to boot the Windows PC from an Ubuntu live CD and install <kbd>chntpw</kbd> (4). The live CD will detect the drives on the computer and the user will just have to identify the one containing the Windows installation.</p>
<p>With this information, the user has to input the following commands in the terminal:</p>
<pre><strong>cd/media</strong>
<strong>ls</strong>
<strong>cd &lt;hdd or ssd label&gt;</strong>
<strong>cd windows/system32/config</strong></pre>
<p>This is the directory that contains the Windows configurations:</p>
<pre><strong>sudo chntpw sam</strong>  </pre>
<p>In the preceding command, <kbd>sam</kbd> is the config file that contains the Windows registry (4). Once opened in the terminal, there will be a list showing all the user accounts on the PC and a prompt to edit the users. There are two options: clearing the password or resetting the old password.</p>
<p>The command to reset the password can be issued in the terminal as:</p>
<pre><strong>sudo chntpw -u &lt;user&gt; SAM</strong>  </pre>
<p>As mentioned in the previously discussed example, when users cannot remember their Windows passwords, they can recover their accounts using the live CD without having to disrupt the Windows installation. There are many other live recovery processes for systems, and all share some similarities. The existing system is never wiped off completely.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Organizations need to protect their networks and IT infrastructure from total failure. Contingency planning is the process of putting in place interim measures to allow for quick recovery from failures and at the same time limit the extent of damage caused by the failures (5). This is the reason why contingency planning is a critical responsibility that all organizations should undertake. The planning process involves the identification of risks that the IT infrastructure is subject to and then coming up with remediation strategies to reduce the impact of the risks significantly. There are many risks that face organizations, ranging from natural disasters to the careless actions of users. The impacts that these risks may cause range from mild, such as disk failures, to severe impacts, such as the physical destruction of a server farm. Even though organizations tend to dedicate resources toward the prevention of the occurrence of such risks, it is impossible to eliminate all of them (5). One of the reasons why they cannot be eliminated is that organizations depend on many critical resources that reside outside their control, such as telecommunications. Other reasons include the advancements of threats and uncontrollable actions of internal users either due to negligence or malice.</p>
<p>Therefore, organizations must come to the realization that they could one day wake to a disaster that has occurred and caused severe damage. They must have sound contingency plans with reliable execution plans and reasonably scheduled updating schedules. For contingency plans to be effective, organizations must ensure that:</p>
<ul>
<li>They understand the integration between the contingency plan and other business continuity plans</li>
<li>They develop the contingency plans carefully and pay attention to the recovery strategies that they choose, as well as their recovery time objectives</li>
<li>They develop the contingency plans with an emphasis on exercise, training, and updating tasks</li>
</ul>
<p>A contingency plan must address the following IT platforms and provide adequate strategies and techniques for recovering them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Workstations, laptops, and smartphones</li>
<li>Servers</li>
<li>Websites</li>
<li>The intranet</li>
<li>Wide area networks</li>
<li>Distributed systems (if any)</li>
<li>Server rooms or firms (if any)</li>
</ul>

<p>IT contingency planning helps organizations to prepare for future unfortunate events to ensure that they are in a position to respond to them timely and effectively. Future unfortunate events might be caused by hardware failure, cybercrime, natural disasters, and unprecedented human errors. When they happen, an organization needs to keep going, even after suffering significant damage. This is the reason why IT contingency planning is essential. The IT contingency planning process is made up of the following elaborated five steps.</p>

<p>A good contingency plan must be based on a clear policy that defines the organization's contingency objectives and establishes the employees responsible for contingency planning. All the senior employees must support the contingency program. They should, therefore, be included in developing a site-wide, agreed-upon contingency planning policy that outlines the roles and responsibilities of contingency planning. The policy they come up with must contain the following key elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>The scope that the contingency plan will cover</li>
<li>The resources required</li>
<li>The training needs of the organizational users</li>
<li>Testing, exercising, and maintenance schedules</li>
<li>Backup schedules and their storage locations</li>
<li>The definitions of the roles and responsibilities of the people that are part of the contingency plan</li>

<p>Doing <strong>business impact analysis</strong> (<strong>BIA</strong>) will help the contingency planning coordinators to easily characterize an organization's system requirements and their interdependencies. This information will assist them in determining the organization's contingency requirements and priorities when coming up with the contingency plan. The main purpose of conducting a BIA, however, is to correlate different systems with the critical services that they offer (6). From this information, the organization can identify the individual consequences of a disruption to each system. Business impact analysis should be done in three steps, as illustrated in the following diagram:</p>

<p>Although the IT infrastructure can at times be complex and have numerous components, only a few are critical. These are the resources that support the core business processes, such as payroll processing, transaction processing, or an e-commerce shop checkout. The critical resources are the servers, the network, and the communication channels. Different businesses may, however, have their own distinct critical resources.</p>

<p>For each of the identified critical resources, the business should identify their allowable outage times. The maximum allowable outage time is the period of unavailability of a resource within which the business will not feel major impacts (6). Again, different organizations will have different maximum allowable outage times depending on their core business processes. An e-commerce shop, for instance, has less maximum allowable outage time for its network compared to a manufacturing industry. The organization needs to keenly observe its key processes and come up with estimates of the maximum allowable time that they can remain unavailable without having adverse consequences. The best outage time estimates should be obtained by balancing the cost of a disruption and the cost of recovering an IT resource.</p>

<p>From the information that the organization will have collected from the preceding step, it should prioritize the resources that should be restored first. The most critical resources, such as communication channels and the network, are almost always the first priority. However, this is still subject to the nature of the organization. Some organizations may even prioritize the restoration of production lines higher than the restoration of the network.</p>

<p>After conducting the BIA, the organization will have vital information concerning its systems and their recovery requirements. Some of the impacts that are uncovered in the BIA could be mitigated through preventative measures. These are measures that can be put in place to detect, deter, or reduce the impact of disruptions to the system. If preventative measures are feasible and at the same time not very costly, they should be put in place to assist in the recovery of the system. However, at times, it may become too costly to put in place preventative measures for all types of disruptions that may occur. There is a very wide range of preventative controls available, from those that prevent power interruptions to those that prevent fires.</p>

<p>These are the strategies that will be used to restore the IT infrastructure in a quick and effective manner after a disruption has occurred. Recovery strategies must be developed with a focus on the information obtained from the BIA. There are several considerations that have to be made while choosing between alternative strategies, such as costs, security, site-wide compatibility, and the organization's recovery time objectives (7).</p>
<p>Recovery strategies should also consist of combinations of methods that are complementary and cover the entire threat landscape facing an organization. </p>
<p>The following are the most commonly used recovery methods.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Occasionally, the data contained in systems should be backed up. The backup intervals should, however, be short enough to capture reasonably recent data (7). In the instance of a disaster that leads to the loss of the systems and the data therein, the organization can easily recover. It can reinstall the system and then load the most recent backup and get back on its feet. Data backup policies should be created and implemented. The policies at the very least should cover the backup storage sites, naming conventions for the backups, the rotation frequency, and the methods for the transmission of the data to backup sites (7).</p>
<p>The following diagram illustrates the complete backup process:</p>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="353" width="516" src="assets/eef4bd5a-0bfe-4f4c-8375-d6e1ce38cb68.png"/></div>
<p>Cloud backups have the advantage of cost, reliability, availability, and size. Since the organization does not buy the hardware or meet the maintenance costs of the cloud servers, it is cheaper. Since cloud backups are always online, they are more reliable and available than backups on external storage devices. Lastly, the flexibility to rent as much space as one wants gives the advantage of storage capacity that grows with demand. The two leading disadvantages of cloud computing are privacy and security.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>There are some disruptions that have long-term effects. These cause an organization to close operations at a given site for a long period. The contingency plan should provide options to continue business operations in an alternative facility.</p>
<p>There are three types of alternative sites: sites owned by the organization, sites acquired through agreements with internal or external entities, and sites commercially acquired through leases (7). Alternative sites are categorized based on their readiness to continue business operations. Cold sites are those that have all the adequate supportive resources for the carrying out of IT operations. The organization, however, has to install the necessary IT equipment and telecommunication services to reestablish the IT infrastructure. Warm sites are partially equipped and maintained in a state where they are ready to continue offering the moved IT systems. However, they require some preparation in order to be fully operational. Hot sites are adequately equipped and staffed to continue with IT operations when the main site is hit with a disaster. Mobile sites are transportable office spaces that come with all the necessary IT equipment to host IT systems. Lastly, mirrored sites are redundant facilities that have the same IT systems and data as the main site and can continue operations seamlessly when the main site is facing a disaster.</p>
<p>The following is a summary of the alternative sites in ascending order of their readiness to continue with operations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cold sites
<ul>
<li>Have the supportive resources ready </li>
<li>Require the installation of IT equipment and telecommunication services</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Warm sites
<ul>
<li>Partially equipped and kept in a ready state</li>
<li>Require preparation through staffing to be operational</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hot sites
<ul>
<li>Adequately equipped and staffed to continue with IT operations</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mirrored sites
<ul>
<li>Exact replicas of the main sites</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Once a destructive disaster occurs, thus damaging critical hardware and software, the organization will have to make arrangements to have these replaced. There are three options that the contingency plan may go for. One of these is vendor agreements, where the vendors are notified to respond to a disaster with the necessary replacements. The other option is an equipment inventory, where the organization purchases replacements for critical IT equipment in advance and safely stores them. Once a disaster strikes, the replacement equipment may be used for replacements in the main site or installed in the alternative sites to reestablish the IT services. Lastly, the organization might opt to use any existing compatible equipment as the replacement for damaged equipment. This option includes borrowing equipment from alternative sites.</p>

<p>Once the contingency plan has been developed, it needs to be tested so as to identify the deficiencies that it may have. Testing also needs to be done to evaluate the readiness of employees to implement the plan when a disaster happens. Tests of contingency plans must focus on the speed of recovery from backups and alternative sites, the collaboration between recovery personnel, the performance of recovered systems on alternative sites, and the ease of restoring normal operations. Testing should be done in a worst-case scenario and should be conducted through classroom exercises or functional exercises.</p>
<p>Classroom exercises are the least costly, as the employees are mostly walked through the recovery operations in class before doing a practical exercise.</p>
<p>Functional exercises, on the other hand, are more demanding and require a disaster to be mimicked and the staff to be taught practically how they can respond.</p>
<p>Theoretical training is used to supplement practical training and reinforce what the employees learned during the exercises. Training should be conducted annually at the very least.</p>

<p>The contingency plan needs to be maintained in an adequate state so that it can respond to an organization's current risks, requirements, organization structure, and policies. Therefore, it should keep on being updated to reflect the changes made by an organization or changes in the threat landscape. The plan needs to be reviewed regularly and updated if necessary, and the updates should be documented. The review should be done at least annually and all the changes noted should be effected within a short period of time. This is to prevent the occurrence of a disaster that the organization is not yet prepared for.</p>

<p>The aforementioned processes that form part of the disaster recovery plan can achieve better results if certain best practices are followed. One of these is having an offsite location to store archived backups. The cloud is a ready solution for safe off-site storage.</p>
<p>Another practice is to keep recording any changes made to the IT infrastructure to ease the process of reviewing the suitability of the contingency plan against the new systems. It is also good to have proactive monitoring of IT systems so as to determine when a disaster is occurring early enough and to start the recovery process. Organizations should also implement fault-tolerant systems that can withstand a certain degree of exposure to a disaster. Implementing a <strong>redundant array of independent disks</strong> (<strong>RAID</strong>) for servers is one way of achieving redundancy. It is also good to test the integrity of the backups that are made to ensure that they have no errors. It would be disappointing for an organization to realize after a disaster that its backups have errors and are useless. Lastly, the organization should regularly test its process of restoring a system from backups. All the IT staff need to be fully knowledgeable about this.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we have discussed ways in which organizations prepare to ensure business continuity during disasters. We have talked about the disaster recovery planning process. We have highlighted what needs to be done to identify the risks faced, prioritize the critical resources to be recovered, and determine the most appropriate recovery strategies. In this chapter, we have also discussed the live recovery of systems while they remain online. We have focused a lot on contingency planning, and discussed the entire contingency planning process, touching on how a reliable contingency plan needs to be developed, tested, and maintained.</p>
<p>Lastly, in this chapter, we have provided some best practices that can be used in the recovery process to achieve optimal results.</p>
<p>This chapter brings to a conclusion the discussion about the attack strategies used by cybercriminals and the vulnerability management and disaster recovery measures that targets can employ.</p>
