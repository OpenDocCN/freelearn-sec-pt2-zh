    the cause and prevent a similar attack in the future. However, an organization
    cannot fully depend on protecting itself from attacks and all the risks that it
    faces. The organization is exposed to a wide range of disasters such that it is
    impossible to have protective measures against them. The causes of a disaster
    to the IT infrastructure can either be natural or man-made. Natural disasters
    are ones that result from environmental hazards or acts of nature. These include
    blizzards, wildfires, hurricanes, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, floods, lightning
    strikes, and even asteroids falling from the sky and impacting the ground. Man-made
    disasters are ones that arise from the actions of human users or external human
    actors. They include fires, cyber warfare, nuclear explosions, hacking, power
    surges, and accidents, among others.

    In previous chapters, we discussed ransomware called WannaCry, and explained that
    it hit over 150 countries within a short time span. It caused huge losses in terms
    of money and even led to deaths when it encrypted computers used for sensitive
    functions. This is one of the many dynamic changes that affect IT infrastructures
    and force organizations to quickly adapt. Therefore, a good disaster recovery
    plan must be updated often (3). Most of the organizations hit by WannaCry were
    unprepared for it and had no idea what actions  they should have taken. The attack
    only lasted a few days, but caught many organizations unaware. This clearly shows
    that disaster recovery plans should be updated based on need rather than on a
    rigid schedule. Therefore, the last step in the disaster recovery process should
    be the setting up of an updating schedule. This schedule should also make provisions
    for updates to be done when they are needed, too.

    might also not approve an ambitious plan that seems to be a little bit costly.
    Another challenge is the incompleteness of the **recovery time objective** (**RTO**)
    that DR teams come up with. RTOs are the key determiners of the maximum acceptable
    downtime for an organization. It is at times difficult for the DR team to come
    up with a cost-effective plan that is within the RTO. Lastly, there is the challenge
    of outdated plans. The IT infrastructure dynamically changes in its attempts to
    counter the threats that it faces. Therefore, it is a huge task to keep the disaster
    recovery plan updated, and some organizations fail to do this. Outdated plans
    may be ineffective and may be unable to recover the organization when disasters
    caused by new threat vectors happen.

    recovery mechanisms mean that the affected system has to be taken offline, some
    backup files are installed, and then the system is brought back online. There
    are some organizations that have systems that cannot enjoy the luxury of being
    taken offline for recovery to be done. There are other systems that are structurally
    built in a way that they cannot be brought down for recovery. In both instances,
    a live recovery has to be done. A live recovery can be done in two ways. The first
    involves a clean system with the right configurations and uncorrupted backup files
    being installed on top of the faulty system. The end result is that the faulty
    system is gotten rid of, together with its files, and a new one takes over.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second type of live recovery is where data recovery tools are used on a
    system that is still online. The recovery tools may run an update on all the existing
    configurations to change them to the right ones. It may also replace faulty files
    with recent backups. This type of recovery is used when there is some valuable
    data that is to be recovered in the existing system. It allows for the system
    to be changed without affecting the underlying files. It also allows recovery
    to be done without doing a complete system restore. A good example is the recovery
    of Windows using a Linux live CD. The live CD can do many recovery processes,
    thereby saving the user from having to install a new version of Windows and thus
    losing all the existing programs (4). The live CD can, for instance, be used to
    reset or change a Windows PC password. The Linux tool used to reset or change
    passwords is called `chntpw`. An attacker does not need any root privileges to
    perform this. The user needs to boot the Windows PC from an Ubuntu live CD and
    install `chntpw` (4). The live CD will detect the drives on the computer and the
    user will just have to identify the one containing the Windows installation.

    failure. Contingency planning is the process of putting in place interim measures
    to allow for quick recovery from failures and at the same time limit the extent
    of damage caused by the failures (5). This is the reason why contingency planning
    is a critical responsibility that all organizations should undertake. The planning
    process involves the identification of risks that the IT infrastructure is subject
    to and then coming up with remediation strategies to reduce the impact of the
    risks significantly. There are many risks that face organizations, ranging from
    natural disasters to the careless actions of users. The impacts that these risks
    may cause range from mild, such as disk failures, to severe impacts, such as the
    physical destruction of a server farm. Even though organizations tend to dedicate
    resources toward the prevention of the occurrence of such risks, it is impossible
    to eliminate all of them (5). One of the reasons why they cannot be eliminated
    is that organizations depend on many critical resources that reside outside their

    outage times depending on their core business processes. An e-commerce shop, for
    instance, has less maximum allowable outage time for its network compared to a
    manufacturing industry. The organization needs to keenly observe its key processes
    and come up with estimates of the maximum allowable time that they can remain
    unavailable without having adverse consequences. The best outage time estimates
    should be obtained by balancing the cost of a disruption and the cost of recovering

- en: Once a destructive disaster occurs, thus damaging critical hardware and software,
    the organization will have to make arrangements to have these replaced. There
    are three options that the contingency plan may go for. One of these is vendor
    agreements, where the vendors are notified to respond to a disaster with the necessary
    replacements. The other option is an equipment inventory, where the organization
    purchases replacements for critical IT equipment in advance and safely stores
    them. Once a disaster strikes, the replacement equipment may be used for replacements
    in the main site or installed in the alternative sites to reestablish the IT services.
    Lastly, the organization might opt to use any existing compatible equipment as
    the replacement for damaged equipment. This option includes borrowing equipment
    from alternative sites.

    identify the deficiencies that it may have. Testing also needs to be done to evaluate
    the readiness of employees to implement the plan when a disaster happens. Tests
    of contingency plans must focus on the speed of recovery from backups and alternative
    sites, the collaboration between recovery personnel, the performance of recovered
    systems on alternative sites, and the ease of restoring normal operations. Testing
    should be done in a worst-case scenario and should be conducted through classroom
    exercises or functional exercises.

    through the recovery operations in class before doing a practical exercise.
  prefs: []

    to be mimicked and the staff to be taught practically how they can respond.

    what the employees learned during the exercises. Training should be conducted

- en: The contingency plan needs to be maintained in an adequate state so that it
    can respond to an organization's current risks, requirements, organization structure,
    and policies. Therefore, it should keep on being updated to reflect the changes
    made by an organization or changes in the threat landscape. The plan needs to
    be reviewed regularly and updated if necessary, and the updates should be documented.
    The review should be done at least annually and all the changes noted should be
    effected within a short period of time. This is to prevent the occurrence of a
    disaster that the organization is not yet prepared for.

- en: The aforementioned processes that form part of the disaster recovery plan can
    achieve better results if certain best practices are followed. One of these is
    having an offsite location to store archived backups. The cloud is a ready solution
    for safe off-site storage.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another practice is to keep recording any changes made to the IT infrastructure
    to ease the process of reviewing the suitability of the contingency plan against
    the new systems. It is also good to have proactive monitoring of IT systems so
    as to determine when a disaster is occurring early enough and to start the recovery
    process. Organizations should also implement fault-tolerant systems that can withstand
    a certain degree of exposure to a disaster. Implementing a **redundant array of
    independent disks** (**RAID**) for servers is one way of achieving redundancy.
    It is also good to test the integrity of the backups that are made to ensure that
    they have no errors. It would be disappointing for an organization to realize
    after a disaster that its backups have errors and are useless. Lastly, the organization
    should regularly test its process of restoring a system from backups. All the
    IT staff need to be fully knowledgeable about this.

    business continuity during disasters. We have talked about the disaster recovery
    planning process. We have highlighted what needs to be done to identify the risks
    faced, prioritize the critical resources to be recovered, and determine the most
    appropriate recovery strategies. In this chapter, we have also discussed the live
    recovery of systems while they remain online. We have focused a lot on contingency
    planning, and discussed the entire contingency planning process, touching on how
    a reliable contingency plan needs to be developed, tested, and maintained.
