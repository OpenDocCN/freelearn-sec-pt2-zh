<p>In the previous chapters, you learned about the recovery process and how important it is to have a good recovery strategy and the appropriate tools in place. Oftentimes, an exploitation of a vulnerability might lead to a disaster recovery scenario. Therefore, it is imperative to have a system in place that can prevent the vulnerabilities from being exploited in the first place. But how can you prevent a vulnerability from being exploited if you don't know whether your system is vulnerable? The answer is to have a vulnerability management process in place that can be used to identify vulnerabilities and help you mitigate them. This chapter focuses on the mechanisms that organizations and individuals need to put in place to make it hard to be hacked. It might be impossible for a system to be 100% safe and secure; however, there are some measures that can be employed to make it difficult for hackers to complete their missions.</p>
<p>This chapter will cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating a vulnerability management strategy</li>
<li>Vulnerability management tools</li>
<li>Implementing vulnerability management</li>
<li>Best practices for vulnerability management</li>
</ul>

<p>The optimal approach to creating an effective vulnerability management strategy is to make it a vulnerability management life cycle. Just like the attack life cycle, the vulnerability management life cycle schedules all vulnerability mitigation processes in an orderly way. This enables targets and victims of cybersecurity incidents to mitigate the damage that they have incurred or might incur. The right counteractions are scheduled to be performed at the right time to find and address vulnerabilities before attackers can abuse them.</p>
<p>The vulnerability management strategy is composed of six distinct phases. This section will discuss each of them and what they are meant to protect against. It will also discuss the challenges that are expected to be met at each of those stages.</p>

<p>The first stage in the vulnerability management strategy should be the making of an inventory. However, many organizations lack an effective asset register and, therefore, have a hard time when securing their devices. An asset inventory is a tool that security administrators can use to go through the devices an organization has and highlight the ones that need to be covered by security software. In the vulnerability management strategy, an organization should start by giving one employee the responsibility of managing an asset inventory to ensure that all devices are recorded and that the inventory remains up to date (1). The asset inventory is also a great tool that network and system admins can use to quickly find and patch devices and systems.</p>
<p>Without the inventory, some devices could be left behind when new security software is being patched or installed. These are the devices and systems that attackers will target. There are hacking tools, as was seen in <a href="d07abf73-093e-4004-b690-1aa70db11902.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Compromising the System</em>, that can scan the network and find out which systems are unpatched. The lack of an asset inventory may also lead to the organization underspending or overspending on security. This is because it cannot correctly determine the devices and systems that it needs to purchase protection for. The challenges that are expected at this stage are many. IT departments in today's organizations are often faced with poor change management, rogue servers, and a lack of clear network boundaries. Organizations also lack effective tools for maintaining the inventory in a consistent manner.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The second stage in the vulnerability management strategy is controlling how information flows into an organization. The most critical information flow is internet traffic coming from an organization's network. There has been an increase in the number of worms, viruses and other malware threats that organizations need to guard against. There has also been an increase in the traffic flow both inside and outside of local networks. The increased traffic flow threatens to bring more malware into an organization. Therefore, attention should be paid to this information flow to prevent threats from getting in or out of a network. Other than the threat of malware, information management is also concerned with the organization's data. Organizations store different types of data, and some of it must never get into the hands of the wrong people. Information, such as trade secrets and the personal information of customers, could cause irreparable damage if it is accessed by hackers. An organization may lose its reputation, and could also be fined huge sums of money for failing to protect user data. Competing organizations could get secret formulas, prototypes, and business secrets, allowing them to outshine the victim organization. Therefore, information management is vital in the vulnerability management strategy.</p>
<p>In order to achieve this, an organization could deploy a <strong>computer security incident response team</strong> (<strong>CSIRT</strong>) to handle any threats to its information storage and transmission (2). Said team will not just respond to hacking incidents but will inform management when there are intrusion attempts to access sensitive information and the best course of action to take. Apart from this team, an organization could adopt the policy of least privilege when it comes to accessing information. This policy ensures that users are denied access to all information apart from that which is necessary for them to perform their duties. Reducing the number of people accessing sensitive information is a good measure towards reducing the avenues of attack (2). Lastly, in the information management strategy, organizations could put in place mechanisms to detect and stop malicious people from gaining access to files. These mechanisms can be put in place in the network to ensure that malicious traffic is denied entry and suspicious activities such as snooping are reported. They could also be put in place on end user devices to prevent the illegal copying or reading of data.</p>
<p>There are a few challenges in this step of the vulnerability management strategy. To begin with, over the years information has grown in breadth and depth, making it hard to handle and also to control who can access it. Valuable information about potential hackings, such as alerts, has also exceeded the processing capabilities of most IT departments. It is not a surprise for legitimate alerts to be brushed off as false positives because of the number of similar alerts that the IT department receives daily.</p>
<p>There have been incidents where organizations have been exploited shortly after ignoring alerts from network monitoring tools. The IT department is not entirely to blame as there is a huge amount of new information that such tools are generating per hour, most of which turn out to be false positives. Traffic flowing in and out of organizational networks has also become complex. Malware is being transmitted in nonconventional ways. There is also a challenge when it comes to conveying information about new vulnerabilities to normal users who do not understand technical IT jargon. All these challenges together affect the response times and actions that an organization can take in the case of potential or verified hacking attempts.</p>

<p>This is the third step in the vulnerability management strategy. Before risks can be mitigated, the security team should do an in-depth analysis of the vulnerabilities that it faces. In an ideal IT environment, the security team would be able to respond to all vulnerabilities since it would have sufficient resources and time. However, in reality, there are a great many limiting factors when it comes to the resources available to mitigate risks. That is why risk assessment is crucial. In this step, an organization has to prioritize some vulnerabilities over others and allocate resources to mitigate against them. Risk assessment is comprised of five stages.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>Risk assessment starts with scope identification. An organization's security team only has a limited budget. It, therefore, has to identify areas that it will cover and those that it will not. It determines what will be protected, its sensitivity, and to what level it needs to be protected. The scope needs to be defined carefully since it will determine from where internal and external vulnerability analysis will occur.</p>

<p>After the scope has been defined, data needs to be collected about the existing policies and procedures that are in place to safeguard the organization from cyber threats. This can be done through interviews, questionnaires, and surveys administered to personnel, such as users and network administrators. All the networks, applications, and systems that are covered in the scope should have their relevant data collected. This data could include the following: service pack, OS version, applications running, location, access control permissions, intrusion-detection tests, firewall tests, network surveys, and port scans. This information will shed more light on the type of threats that the networks, systems, and applications are facing.</p>

<p>Organizations set up policies and procedures to govern the usage of their resources. They ensure that they are put to rightful and safe use. It is therefore important to review and analyze the existing policies and procedures. There could be inadequacies in the policies. There could also be impracticalities in some policies. While analyzing the policies and procedures, one should also determine their level of compliance on the part of the users and administrators. Simply because the policies and procedures are formulated and disseminated do not mean that they are complied with. The punishments set for noncompliance should also be analyzed. In the end, it will be known whether an organization has sufficient policies and procedures to address vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>After the analysis of the policies and procedures, vulnerability analysis has to be done in order to determine the exposure of the organization and to find out whether there are enough safeguards to protect itself. Vulnerability analysis is done using the tools that were discussed in <a href="0acb9516-3ff9-43d8-a9f8-1d1d34232b7e.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Reconnaissance</em>. The tools used here are the same tools that hackers use to determine an organization's vulnerabilities so that they can decide which exploits to use. Commonly, organizations will call in penetration testers to conduct this process. The biggest setback in vulnerability analysis is the number of false positives that are identified that need to be filtered out. Therefore, various tools have to be used together in order to come up with a reliable list of the existing vulnerabilities in an organization.</p>
<p>The penetration testers need to simulate real attacks and find out the systems and devices that suffer stress and get compromised in the process. At the end of this, the vulnerabilities identified are graded according to the risks that they pose to the organization. Vulnerabilities that have less severity and exposure usually have low ratings. There are three classes in a vulnerability grading system. The minor class is for vulnerabilities that require lots of resources to exploit, yet have a very little impact on the organization. The moderate class is for those vulnerabilities that have moderate potential for damage, exploitability, and exposure. The high-severity class is for vulnerabilities that require fewer resources to exploit but can do lots of damage to an organization if they are.</p>

<p>Threats to an organization are actions, code, or software that could lead to the tampering, destruction, or interruption of data and services in an organization. Threat analysis is done to look at the risks that could happen in an organization. The threats identified must be analyzed in order to determine their effects on an organization. Threats are graded in a similar manner to vulnerabilities but are measured in terms of motivation and capability. For instance, an insider may have low motivation to maliciously attack an organization but could have lots of capabilities because of the inside knowledge of the workings of the organization. Therefore, the grading system may have some differences to the one used in the vulnerability analysis. In the end, the threats identified are quantified and graded.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The analysis of the acceptable risks is the last thing done in risk assessment. Here, the existing policies, procedures, and security mechanisms are first assessed to determine whether they are adequate. If they are inadequate, it is assumed that there are vulnerabilities in the organization. The corrective actions are taken to ensure that they are updated and upgraded until they are sufficient. Therefore, the IT department will determine the recommended standards that the safeguards should meet. Whatever is not covered is categorized as an acceptable risk. These risks might, however, become more harmful with time, and therefore they have to be analyzed. It is only after it is determined that they will pose no threat that the risk assessment will end. If they might pose a threat, safeguard standards are updated to address them.</p>
<p>The biggest challenge in this vulnerability management stage is the lack of availability of information. Some organizations do not document their policies, procedures, strategies, processes, and security assets. It might, therefore, be difficult to obtain the information needed in order to complete this stage. It might be easier for small and medium-sized companies to keep documentation of everything, but it is a complex task for big companies. Big companies have multiple lines of business, departments, a lack of enough resources, a lack of disciplined documentation, and overlapping duties. The only solution to ready them for this process is by conducting regular housekeeping activities to ensure that everything important is documented and that staff clearly understand their duties.</p>

<p>Vulnerability assessment closely follows risk assessment in the vulnerability management strategy. This is because the two steps are closely related. Vulnerability assessment involves the identification of vulnerable assets. This phase is conducted through a number of ethical hacking attempts and penetration tests. The servers, printers, workstations, firewalls, routers, and switches on the organizational network are all targeted with these attacks. The aim is to simulate a real hacking scenario with the same tools and techniques that a potential attacker might use. The majority of these tools were discussed in the reconnaissance and compromising the system chapters. The goal in this step is not only to identify the vulnerabilities but also to do so in a fast and accurate manner. The step should yield a comprehensive report of all the vulnerabilities that an organization is exposed to.</p>
<p>The challenges faced in this step are many. The first one to consider should concern what the organization should assess. Without an appropriate asset inventory, an organization will not be able to identify which devices they should focus on. It will also become easy to forget to assess certain hosts, and yet they may be key targets for potential attack. Another challenge has to do with the vulnerability scanners used. Some scanners provide false assessment reports and guide the organization down the wrong path. Of course, false positives will always exist, but some scanning tools exceed the acceptable percentage and keep on coming up with nonexistent vulnerabilities. These may lead to the wasting of the organization's resources when it comes to mitigations. Disruptions are another set of challenges that are experienced at this stage. With all the ethical hacking and penetration-testing activities going on, the network, servers, and workstations suffer. Networking equipment such as firewalls also get sluggish, especially when denial of service attacks are being carried out.</p>
<p>Sometimes, strong attacks will actually bring down servers, disrupting core functions of the organization. This can be addressed by conducting these tests when there are no users using them, or coming up with replacements when core tools are being assessed. There is also the challenge of using the tools themselves. Tools such as Metasploit require you to have a solid understanding of Linux and be experienced with using command-line interfaces. The same is true for many other scanning tools. It is difficult to find scanning tools that offer a good interface and at the same time offer the flexibility of writing custom scripts. Lastly, sometimes scanning tools do not come with a decent reporting feature, and this forces the penetration testers to manually write these reports. Their reports may not be as thorough as those that would have been generated directly by the scanning tools.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Reporting and remediation tracking</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>After the vulnerability assessment comes to the reporting and remediation stage. This phase has two equally important tasks: reporting and remediation. The task of reporting helps the system admins to understand the organization's current state of security and the areas in which it is still insecure, and it points these out to the person responsible. Reporting also gives something tangible to the management so that they can associate it with the future direction of the organization. Reporting normally comes before remediation so that all the information compiled in the vulnerability management phase can seamlessly flow to this phase.</p>
<p>Remediation starts the actual process of ending the cycle of vulnerability management. The vulnerability management phase, as was discussed, comes to a premature ending after analyzing the threats and vulnerabilities as well as outlining the acceptable risks. Remediation compliments this by coming up with solutions to the threats and vulnerabilities identified. All the vulnerable hosts, servers, and networking equipment are tracked down and the necessary steps are established to remove the vulnerabilities as well as protect them from future exploits. It is the most important task in the vulnerability management strategy, and if it is well executed, the vulnerability management is deemed to be a success. Activities in this task include identifying missing patches and checking for available upgrades to all systems in an organization. Solutions are also identified for the bugs that were picked up by scanning tools. Multiple layers of security, such as antivirus programs and firewalls, are also identified at this stage. If this phase is unsuccessful, it makes the whole vulnerability management process pointless.</p>
<p>As expected, this phase sees a coming together of a great many challenges since it is the phase where all vulnerabilities have their solutions identified. The first challenge arises when reporting is partial and does not contain all the required information about the risks that the organization faces. A poorly written report may lead to poor remediation measures and thus leave the organization still exposed to threats. The lack of software documentation may also bring about challenges in this phase. The vendors or manufacturers of software often leave documentation that includes an explanation of how updating is to be done. Without it, it may prove hard to update bespoke software. Poor communication between software vendors and the organization may also bring about challenges when the patching of a system needs to be done. Lastly, remediation can be compromised by the lack of cooperation of the end users. Remediation may introduce downtimes to end users, something that they never want to experience.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Response planning</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Response planning can be thought of as the easiest, but nevertheless a very important, step in the vulnerability management strategy. It is easy because all the hard work will have been done in the previous five steps. It is important because, without its execution, the organization will still be exposed to threats. All that matters in this phase is the speed of execution. Large organizations face major hurdles when it comes to executing it because of a large number of devices that require patches and upgrades.</p>
<p>An incident happened when Microsoft announced the existence of the MS03-023 and released a patch for it. Smaller organizations that have short response plans were able to patch their operating systems with an update shortly after the announcement. However, larger organizations that either lacked or have long response plans for their computers were heavily attacked by hackers. Hackers released the MS Blaster worm to attack the unpatched operating systems barely 26 days after Microsoft gave a working patch to its users. That was enough time for even big companies to patch their systems in totality. However, the lack of response plans or the use of long response plans caused some to fall victim to the worm. The worm caused network sluggishness or outage on the computers it infected. Another famous incident that happened quite recently was that of the WannaCry ransomware. It is the largest ever ransomware attack in history caused by a vulnerability allegedly stolen from the NSA called <strong>Eternal Blue</strong> (3). The attack started in May, but Microsoft had released a patch for the Eternal Blue vulnerability in March. However, it did not release a patch for older versions of Windows, such as XP (3). From March until the day the first attack was recognized, there was enough time for companies to patch their systems. However, most companies had not done so by the time the attack started because of poor response planning. If the attack had not been stopped, even more computers would have fallen victim.</p>
<p>This shows just how important speed is when it comes to response planning. Patches are to be installed the moment that they are made available.</p>
<p>The challenges faced in this phase are many since it involves the actual engagement of end users and their machines. The first of these challenges is getting the appropriate communications out to the right people in time. When a patch is released, hackers are never slow in trying to find ways to compromise the organizations that do not install it. That is why a well-established communication chain is important. Another challenge is accountability. The organization needs to know who to hold accountable for not installing patches. At times, users may be responsible for canceling installations. In other instances, it may be the IT team that did not initiate the patching process in time. There should always be an individual that can be held accountable for not installing patches. The last challenge is the duplication of efforts. This normally occurs in large organizations where there are many IT security personnel. They may use the same response plan, but because of poor communication, they may end up duplicating each other's efforts while making very little progress.</p>

<p>The available vulnerability management tools are many, and for the sake of simplicity, this section will discuss the tools according to the phase that they are used in. Therefore, each phase will have its relevant tools discussed and their pros and cons given. It is worth noting that not all the tools discussed may deal with the vulnerabilities themselves. Their contributions are, however, very important to the whole process.</p>

<p>Peregrine is a software development company that was acquired by HP in 2005. It has released three of the most commonly used asset inventory tools. One of these is the asset center. It is an asset management tool that is specifically fine-tuned to meet the needs of software assets. The tool allows organizations to store licensing information about their software. This is an important piece of information that many other asset inventory systems leave out. This tool can only record information about the devices and software in the organization. However, sometimes there is a need for something that can record details about the network. Peregrine created other inventory tools specifically designed for recording assets on a network. These are the network discovery and desktop inventory tools that are commonly used together. They keep an updated database of all computers and devices connected to an organization's network. They can also provide extensive details about a network, its physical topology, the configurations of the connected computers, and their licensing information. All these tools are provided to the organization under one interface. Peregrine tools are scalable, they easily integrate, and are flexible enough to cater for changes in a network. Their disadvantage shows itself when there are rogue desktop clients in a network since the tools will normally ignore them.</p>

<p>The LANDesk Management Suite is a vigorous asset inventory tool that is commonly used for network management (4). The tool can provide asset management, software distribution, license monitoring, and remote-based control functionalities over devices connected to the organizational network (4). The tool has an automated network discovery system that identifies new devices connected to the network. It then checks against the devices that it has in its database and adds the new devices if they have never been added. The tool also uses inventory scans running in the background on clients, and this enables it to know information specific to the client, such as license information (4). The tool is highly scalable and gives users a portable backend database. The cons of this tool are that it cannot be integrated with other tools used in command centers and that it also faces the challenge of locating rogue desktops.</p>

<p>This is a suite of tools created by Latis Networks that provide network discovery functionalities to users (5). The suite comes with three tools tailored for vulnerability management—namely desktop VAM, server VAM, and remote VAM. These three products run in an automated way where they scan and provide a holistic report about a network. The scanning times can also be manually set according to the user's schedule to avoid any network sluggishness that may arise because of the scanning processes. The tools will document all the hosts in a network and list their configurations. The tools will also show the relevant vulnerability scans to be run on each host. This is because the suite is specifically created for vulnerability assessment and management.</p>
<p>The main advantage of this tool is that it scans and records hosts on a network without requiring the installation of a client version on them, like the previously discussed tools. The suite's remote VAM can be used to discover devices running on the perimeter of an internal network from the outside. This is a major advantage when compared to the other inventory tools that have been previously discussed. The suite gives users an option to group the inventory by different business units or through the normal system administrator's sorting methods. The main con of this suite is that, since it does not install a client on the hosts it limits, it is unable to collect in-depth information about them. The main aim of an asset inventory tool is to capture all the relevant information about the devices in an organization, and this suite may at times fail to provide this quality of data.</p>

<p>Foundstone's Enterprise is a tool by Foundscan Engine that performs network discovery using IP addresses. The tool is normally set up by the network administrator to scan for hosts assigned a certain range of IP addresses. The tool can be set to run at scheduled times that the organization deems to be most appropriate. The tool has an enterprise web interface where it lists the hosts and services it has found running on the network. The tool is also said to scan i<span>ntelligently </span>for vulnerabilities that the hosts may have and give periodic reports to the network admin. However, the tool is seen as falling short of being the ideal asset inventory tool since it only collects data related to vulnerability scanning:</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The information management phase concerns the control of the information flow in the organization. This includes the dissemination of information about intrusions and intruders to the right people who can take the recommended actions. There are a number of tools that offer solutions to help with the dissemination of information in organizations. They use simple communication methods such as emails, websites, and distribution lists. Of course, all of these are customized to fit an organization's security incident policies. During security incidents, the first people that have to be informed are those in the incident response team. This is because their speed of action may determine the impacts that security vulnerabilities have in an organization. Most of the tools that can be used to reach them are web-based. One of these tools is the CERT Coordination Center. It facilitates the creation of an online command center that alerts and periodically informs a select number of people via email (6). Another tool is Security Focus, which uses a similar strategy as the CERT tool (7). It creates mailing lists to inform the incident response team when a security incident has been reported.</p>
<p>Symantec Security Response is also another information-management tool (8). There are many advantages of this tool, one of which is that it keeps the incident response team informed. Symantec is renowned globally for its in-depth internet security threat reports. These annual publications are great for learning how cybercriminals are evolving each year. The report also gives meaningful attack statistics. This allows the incident response teams to adequately prepare for certain types of attacks based on the observable trends. As well as this publication, the tool also provides you with the Shadow Data Report, Symantec Intelligence Report, and security white papers (8). The tool also provides threat spotlights for some types of attacks that organizations must prevent. It also has an intelligent system called <strong>DeepSight</strong> that provides 24-7 reporting (8). IT has an A-to-Z listing of risks and threats together with their countermeasures. Finally, the tool provides users with links to Symantec AntiVirus, which can be used to remove malware and treat infected systems. This tool is well-rounded in information management and is, therefore, highly recommendable.</p>
<p>These tools are the most commonly used out of the many available on the internet. The most obvious similarity in all these tools is the use of email alerts through mailing lists. The mailing lists can be set up so that incident responders get the alerts first, and once they have verified a security incident, the rest of the users in an organization can be informed. Organizational security policies are at times good tools that complement these online tools. During an attack, the local security policies can guide users as to what they can do and who they should contact.</p>

<p>Most risk assessment tools are developed in-house since all organizations do not face the same risks at the same time. There are many variations in risk management, and that is why it might be tricky to use only one choice of software as the universal tool to identify and assess the risks that an organization users. The in-house tools that organizations use are checklists developed by the system and network administrators. The checklist should be made up of questions about potential vulnerabilities and threats that the organization is exposed to. These questions will be used by the organization to define the risk levels of the vulnerabilities identified within its network. The following is a set of questions that can be put on the checklist:</p>
<ul>
<li>How can the identified vulnerabilities impact the organization?</li>
<li>Which business resources are at risk of being compromised?</li>
<li>Is there a risk for remote exploitations?</li>
<li>What are the consequences of an attack?</li>
<li>Is the attack reliant on tools or scripts?</li>
<li>How can the attack be mitigated?</li>
</ul>
<p>To complement the checklist, organizations can acquire commercial tools that perform automated risk analysis. One of these tools is <strong>ArcSight Enterprise Security Manager</strong> (<strong>ESM</strong>). It is a threat-detection and compliance-management tool used to detect vulnerabilities and mitigate cybersecurity threats. The tool gathers a lot of security-related data from a network and the hosts connected to it. From the event data that it records, it can make real-time correlations with its database to tell when there are attacks or suspicious actions on the network. It can correlate a maximum of 75,000 events per second. This correlation can also be used to ensure that all events follow the internal rules of the organization. It also recommends methods of mitigating and resolving vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>Because of the increase in the number of cybersecurity threats that face organizations, there has been a corresponding growth in the number of vulnerability-scanning tools. There are many freeware and premium tools for organizations to choose from. Most of these tools were discussed in <a href="0acb9516-3ff9-43d8-a9f8-1d1d34232b7e.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Reconnaissance</em> and <a href="d07abf73-093e-4004-b690-1aa70db11902.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Compromising the System</em>. The two most commonly used vulnerability scanners are Nessus and NMap (the latter of which can be used as a basic vulnerability tool via its scripting function). NMap is highly flexible and can be configured to address the specific scanning needs of the user. It quickly maps a new network and provides information about the assets connected to it and their vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Nessus can be thought of as an advancement of the Nmap scanner. This is because Nessus can perform an in-depth vulnerability assessment of the hosts connected to a network (9). The scanner will be able to determine their operating systems versions, missing patches, and the relevant exploits that can be used against the system. The tool also sorts the vulnerabilities according to their threat levels. Nessus is also highly flexible such that its users can write their own attack scripts and use them against a wide range of hosts on the network (9). The tool has its own scripting language to facilitate this. It is a great feature since, as was stated when we discussed the challenges faced in this step, many scanners do not find the perfect balance between a good interface and a high level of flexibility. There are other related tools that can also be used for scannings, such as Harris STAT, Foundstone's Foundscan, and Zenmap. Their functionalities are, however, similar to those of both Nessus and Nmap.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>This step of the vulnerability management strategy allows incident responders to come up with the appropriate ways to mitigate the risks and vulnerabilities faced by an organization. They need tools that can tell them the current security state of the organization and to track all the remediation efforts. There are many reporting tools, and organizations tend to prefer the ones that have in-depth reporting and can be customized for several audiences. There are many stakeholders in an organization and not all of them can understand technical jargon. At the same time, the IT department wants tools that can give them the technical details without any alterations. Therefore, the separation of audiences is important.</p>
<p>Two tools with such capabilities are Foundstone's Enterprise Manager and the Latis Reporting tool. They have similar functionalities: They both provide reporting features that can be customized to the different needs of users and other stakeholders. Foundstone's Enterprise Manager comes with a customizable dashboard. This dashboard enables its users to retrieve long-term reports and reports that are custom-made for specific people, operating systems, services, and regions. Different regions will affect the language of the report, and this is particularly useful for global companies. The reports generated by these tools will show vulnerability details and their frequency of occurrence.</p>
<p>The two tools also provide remediation-tracking functionalities. The Foundstone tool has an option to assign vulnerabilities to a specific system administrator or IT staff member (10). It can then track the remediation process using tickets. The Latis tool also has the option where it can assign certain vulnerabilities to certain people that are responsible for remedying them. It will also track the progress that the assigned parties make. Upon completion, the Latis tool will perform a validation scan to ascertain that the vulnerability was solved. Remediation tracking is normally aimed at ensuring that someone takes responsibility for addressing a certain vulnerability until it is resolved.</p>

<p>Response planning is the step where most of the resolution, eradication, cleansing, and repair activities take place. Patches and system upgrades also occur at this stage. There are not many commercial tools made to facilitate this step. Mostly, response planning is done through documentation. Documentation helps system and network administrators with the patching and updating process for systems that they are not familiar with. It also helps during changeovers where new staff may be put in charge of systems that they have never used before. Lastly, documentation helps in emergency situations to avoid skipping some steps or making mistakes.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Implementation of vulnerability management</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The implementation of vulnerability management follows the stipulated strategy. The implementation starts with the creation of an asset inventory. This serves as a register of all the hosts in a network and also of the software contained in them. At this stage, an organization has to give a certain IT staff member the task of keeping this inventory updated. The asset inventory at the very least should show the hardware and software assets owned by an organization and their relevant license details. As an optional addition, the inventory should also show the vulnerabilities present in any of these assets. An up-to-date register will come in handy when the organization has to respond to vulnerabilities with fixes to all its assets. The aforementioned tools can properly handle the tasks that are to be carried out at this stage.</p>
<p>After the implementation of the asset inventory, the organization should pay attention to information management. The goal should be the setting up of an effective way to get information about vulnerabilities and cybersecurity incidents to the relevant people within the shortest time possible. The right people to whom to send firsthand information about security incidents are the computer security incident response teams. The tools that were described as being capable of facilitating this stage require the creation of mailing lists. The incident response team members should be on the mailing list that receives the alerts from an organization's security monitoring tools.</p>
<p>There should be separate mailing lists created to allow other stakeholders of the organization to access this information once it has been confirmed. The appropriate actions that other stakeholders ought to take should also be communicated via the mailing lists. The most recommendable tool for this step, which is from Symantec, provides periodic publications to the users in an organization to keep them updated about global cybersecurity incidents. All in all, at the end of this stage, there should be an elaborate communication channel to incident responders and other users when there has been a breach of systems.</p>
<p>Following the implementation of mailing lists for information management, there should be a risk assessment. Risk assessment should be implemented in the manner described in the vulnerability management strategy. It should begin with the identification of the scope. It should be followed by the collection of data about the existing policies and procedures that the organization has been using. Data concerning their compliance should also be collected. After it is collected, the existing policies and procedures should be analyzed so as to determine whether they have been adequate in safeguarding the security of the organization. After this, vulnerability and threat analysis should be done. The threats and vulnerabilities that the organization faces should be categorized according to their severity. Lastly, the organization should define the acceptable risks that it can face without experiencing profound consequences.</p>
<p>The risk assessment should closely be followed by a vulnerability assessment. The vulnerability assessment step, not to be confused with vulnerability analysis of the risk management step, is aimed at identifying the vulnerable assets. Therefore, all the hosts in a network should be ethically hacked or have penetration testing done to determine whether or not they are vulnerable. The process should be thorough and accurate. Any vulnerable assets that are not identified in this step might be the weak link that hackers exploit. Therefore, tools that the supposed hackers would use to attack should be used and to the full extent of their capabilities.</p>
<p>The vulnerability assessment step should be followed by reporting and remediation tracking. All the risks and vulnerabilities identified must be reported back to the stakeholders of the organization. The reports should be comprehensive and touch on all hardware and software assets belonging to the organization. The reports should also be fine-tuned to meet the needs of various audiences. There are audiences that might not understand the technical side of vulnerabilities, and it is, therefore, only fair that they get a simplified version of the reports. Remediation tracking should follow the reports. After the risks and vulnerabilities that the organization faces are identified, the appropriate people to remedy them should be stated. They should be assigned the responsibility for ensuring that all the risks and vulnerabilities are resolved in totality. There should be an elaborate way of tracking the progress of the resolution of the identified threats. The tools that we looked at previously have these features and can ensure that this step is implemented successfully.</p>
<p>The final implementation should be response planning. This is where the organization outlines the actions to take against vulnerabilities and proceeds to take them. This step will confirm whether the preceding five steps were done right. In response planning, the organization should come up with a means of patching, updating, or upgrading the systems that were identified as possessing some risks or vulnerabilities. The hierarchy of severity identified in the risk and vulnerability assessment steps should be followed. This step should be implemented with the aid of the asset inventory so that the organization can confirm that all their assets both hardware and software, have been attended to. The step should not take long as hackers are never too far from attacking using the most recently discovered vulnerabilities. The response planning stage must be completed bearing in mind from when monitoring systems send alerts to incident responders.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Best practices for vulnerability management</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Even with the best tools, execution is all that matters in vulnerability management. Therefore, all the actions that have been identified in the implementation section must be carried out flawlessly. There is a set of best practices for each step of the implementation of the vulnerability management strategy. Starting off with the asset inventory, the organization should establish a single point of authority. There should be one person that can be held responsible if the inventory is not up to date or has inconsistencies. Another best practice is to encourage the use of consistent abbreviations during data entry. It may become confusing to another person trying to go through the inventory if the abbreviations keep on changing. The inventory should also be validated at least once a year. Lastly, it is advisable to treat changes of inventory management systems with the same degree of care as any other change in a management process.</p>
<p>In the information management stage, the biggest achievement that the organization can get is a fast and effective dissemination of information to the relevant audience. One of the best methods for doing this is allowing employees to make the conscious effort of subscribing to mailing lists. Another one is to allow the incident response team to post its own reports, statistics, and advice on a website for the organization's users. The organization should also hold periodic conferences to discuss new vulnerabilities, virus strains, malicious activities, and social engineering techniques with users. It is best if all the users are informed about the threats that they may face and how to deal with them effectively. This has more impact than the mailing lists telling them to do technical things that they are not knowledgeable of. Lastly, the organization should come up with a standardized template of how all the security-related emails will look. It should be a consistent look that is different from the normal email format that users are used to.</p>
<p>The risk assessment step is one of the most manually demanding stages of the vulnerability management life cycle. This is because there are not many commercial tools that can be used here. One of the best practices is to document the ways to review new vulnerabilities as soon as they appear. This will save a lot of time when it comes to mitigating them since the appropriate countermeasures will already be known. Another best practice is to publish the risk ratings to the public or at least to the organizational users. That information may spread and ultimately reach a person that will find it more useful. It is also recommended that you ensure that asset inventories are both available and updated at this stage so that all hosts in a network can be combed through during risk analysis. The incident response team in every organization should also publish a matrix for each tool that the organization has deployed to secure itself. Lastly, the organization should ensure that it has a strict change management process that ensures that incoming staff are made aware of the security posture of the organization and the mechanisms in place to protect it.</p>
<p>The vulnerability assessment step is not so different from the risk assessment step, and therefore the two might borrow from each other's best practices (which we discussed previously). In addition to what has been discussed in risk assessment, it is good practice to seek permission before extensively testing the network. This is because we saw that this step might introduce serious disruptions to an organization and might do actual damage to the hosts. Therefore, a lot of planning ahead needs to happen. Another best practice is to create custom policies to specific environments—that is the different operating systems of the organization's hosts. Lastly, the organization should identify the scanning tools that are best for its hosts. Some methods may be overkill where they do too much scanning and to an unnecessary depth. Other tools are too shallow and do not discover the vulnerabilities in a network.</p>
<p>There are a few tips that may be used in the reporting and remediation tracking stage. One of these is to ensure that there is a reliable tool for sending reports to asset owners concerning the vulnerabilities they had and whether they have been fixed completely. This reduces the number of unnecessary emails received from users whose machines were found to contain vulnerabilities. The IT staff should also meet with management and other stakeholders to find out the type of reports that they want to see. The level of technicality should also be agreed upon. The incident response team should also agree with the management of the remediation time frames and the required resources, and make known the consequences of nonremediation. Lastly, remediation should be performed following the hierarchy of severity. Therefore, the vulnerabilities that pose the most risk should be sorted first.</p>
<p>The response planning step is the conclusion of the whole vulnerability management process. It is where the responses to different vulnerabilities are implemented. There are several best practices that can be used in this step. One of them is to ensure that the response plans are documented and well-known by the incident response team and the normal users. There should also be fast and accurate information flow to the normal users concerning the progress of fixing the vulnerabilities identified. Since there is a chance of failure after machines are updated or patches installed, contact information should be provided to the end users so that they can reach out to the IT team when such cases arise. Lastly, the incident response team should be given easy access to the network so that they can implement their fixes faster.</p>

<p>To create a scan, click on the <span class="packt_screen">New Scan</span> icon in the upper-right corner. The <span class="packt_screen">Scan Templates</span> page will appear, as shown in <em>Figure 5</em>:</p>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/c17a11c3-2934-4a24-b8b3-62a04c0cc73c.jpg"/></div>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Figure 5 - Scan Templates</div>
<p>You can choose any template listed on the <span class="packt_screen">Scan Templates</span> page. We will choose <span class="packt_screen">Basic Network Scan</span> for our test. The <span class="packt_screen">Basic Network Scan</span> performs a full system scan that is suitable for any host. For example, you could use this template to perform an internal vulnerability scan on your organization's systems. As you choose <span class="packt_screen">Basic Network Scan</span>, the <span class="packt_screen">Settings</span> page will be launched, as shown in <em>Figure 6</em>.</p>
<p>Name your scan "TEST" and add a description. Enter IP scanning details on your home network. Keep in mind that Nessus Home allows you to scan up to 16 IP addresses per scanner. Save the configuration and on the next screen, click the <span class="packt_screen">Play</span> button to launch the scan. Depending on how many devices you have on your network, the scan will take a while.</p>

<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Figure 6 - Scan Configuration</div>
<p>Once Nessus finishes scanning, click on the related scan; you'll see a bunch of color-coded graphs for each device on your network. Each color on the graph refers to different results, from information to the danger of a vulnerability, starting from the low level and ranging to critical. In <em>Figure 7</em>, we have three hosts (<span class="packt_screen">192.168.0.25</span>, <span class="packt_screen">192.168.0.1</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">192.168.0.11</span>):</p>

<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Figure 7 - Test results</div>
<p>After the Nessus vulnerability scan, the results will be shown as displayed in <em>Figure 8</em>.</p>
<p>Click on any IP address to display the vulnerabilities found on the selected device, as shown in <em>Figure 9</em>. I chose <span class="packt_screen">192.168.0.1</span> to see the details of the vulnerability scan:</p>

<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Figure 8 - Vulnerabilities</div>
<p>When an individual vulnerability is selected, it displays more details of that particular vulnerability. My <span class="packt_screen">UPnP Internet Gateway Device (IGD) Protocol Detection</span> vulnerability is shown in <em>Figure 9</em>. It gives lots of information about related details, such as the <span class="packt_screen">Description</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Solution</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Plugin Details</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Risk Information</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Vulnerability Information</span>:</p>

<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Figure 10 - Exporting results</div>
<p>In my case, I chose a PDF format and saved the vulnerability scan results. As shown in <em>Figure 11</em>, the report gives detailed information based on the IP addresses scanned. The Nessus scan report presents extensive data about the vulnerabilities detected on the networks. The report can be especially useful to security teams. They can use this report to identify vulnerabilities and the affected hosts in their network, and take the required action to mitigate vulnerabilities:</p>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="416" width="849" src="assets/7003afda-2935-44bb-be9f-3725d6ed51c0.png"/></div>

<p>Nessus provides a lot of functionality and ability in one tool. Compared to other network scanning tools, it is fairly user-friendly, had easy-to-update plug-ins, and has nice reporting tools for upper management. Using this tool and seeing the vulnerabilities will help you gain knowledge of your systems, and also teach you how to protect them. New vulnerabilities are released almost daily, and in order to keep your systems consistently secure, you have to scan them regularly.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that finding the vulnerabilities before hackers take advantage of them is a great first step in keeping your systems safe.</p>

<p>The Secunia <strong>Personal Software Inspector</strong> (<strong>PSI</strong>) is a free security tool that identifies vulnerabilities in non-Microsoft (third-party) systems.</p>
<p>PSI scans installed software on your PC and identifies programs in need of security updates to safeguard your PC against cybercriminals. It then helps you to get the necessary software security updates to keep it safe. To make it easier, PSI even automates the updates for your unsecured programs</p>
<p>This is a free vulnerability assessment tool that is complementary to any antivirus software. It constantly monitors your system for unsecured software installations, notifies you when an unsecured application is installed, and even provides you with detailed instructions for updating the application when updates are available.</p>
<p>To download Secunia PSI, simply visit their website at <span class="URLPACKT"><a href="https://www.flexera.com/enterprise/products/software-vulnerability-management/personal-software-inspector/">https://www.flexera.com/enterprise/products/software-vulnerability-management/personal-software-inspector/</a>.</span></p>
<p>Once you install the software, it will examine your computer and give you a percentage score:</p>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="565" width="763" src="assets/54bf785e-1ab1-4fa4-894d-30ec78319156.png"/></div>
<p>If you are not at 100%, you need to patch your other missing updates until you have updated all of your software:</p>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="546" width="737" src="assets/5da65b34-b4fb-4350-a97a-1af408c02413.png"/></div>
<p>But what if you have more computers? The same scanning capabilities of the PSI are available in the commercial edition: Secunia <strong>Corporate Software Inspector</strong> (<strong>CSI</strong>), found at <a href="https://www.flexera.com/enterprise/products/software-vulnerability-management/corporate-software-inspector/"><span class="URLPACKT">https://www.flexera.com/enterprise/products/software-vulnerability-management/corporate-software-inspector/</span></a>.</p>
<p>The CSI also provides full integration with existing Microsoft deployment tools SCCM and WSUS, so you can now manage the deployment of critical patches for non-Microsoft updates in the same manner in which you deploy Microsoft updates.</p>
<p>Secunia CSI provides the vulnerability intelligence, vulnerability scanning, patch creation, and patch deployment tools to effectively address the challenge of third-party application patch management.</p>

<p>Organizations are finding themselves under the pressure of being forced to react quickly to the dynamically increasing number of cybersecurity threats. Since the attackers have been using an attack life cycle, organizations have also been forced to come up with a vulnerability management life cycle. The vulnerability management life cycle is designed to counter the efforts made by the attackers in the quickest and most effective way. This chapter has discussed the vulnerability management life cycle in terms of the vulnerability management strategy. It has gone through the steps of asset inventory creation, the management of information flow, the assessment of risks, assessment of vulnerabilities, reporting and remediation, and finally the planning of the appropriate responses. It has explained the importance of each step in the vulnerability management phase and how each should be carried out. The asset inventory has been described as crucial to the strategy because it is the point where all the details about the hosts are listed to assist in a thorough sanitization of all machines that may have vulnerabilities. The critical function of the information management step in disseminating information in a fast and reliable way has also been highlighted, as well as the tools commonly used to achieve it. The risk identification and classification functions of the risk assessment step have also been discussed. The chapter has also discussed the identification of vulnerabilities in hosts in the vulnerability assessment phase. The roles played by reporting and remediation tracking to inform all stakeholders and follow up on remediation have also been touched upon. The chapter has also discussed the final execution of all responses in the response planning step. The best practices for completing each of the steps successfully have also been discussed.</p>

<p>This chapter has outlined the types of response that organizations are expected to provide against attackers. The previous chapters have discussed the attack life cycle and outlined the tools and techniques that attackers normally come packed with. From these tools and techniques, a life cycle capable of mitigating them was designed. This chapter has discussed an effective vulnerability management life cycle composed of six steps. Each of the steps is aimed at making the life cycle effective and thorough in mitigating the vulnerabilities that may be in an organization that attackers may exploit. The well-planned life cycle ensures that not a single host of an organizational network is left exposed to attackers. The life cycle also ensures that the organization ends up with a fully secured IT environment and that it is hard for attackers to find any vulnerabilities to exploit. This chapter has given a set of best practices for each step of the life cycle. These best practices are aimed at ensuring that the incident response teams and the IT staff members make an exhaustive use of each step to secure the organization. In the next chapter, you will learn about the importance of logs and how you can analyze them.</p>
