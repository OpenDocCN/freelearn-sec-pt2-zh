			<p>Vulnerability management is the process of using tools, processes, and knowledge to reduce risk related to IT systems. This includes the entire life cycle, from initially discovering vulnerabilities through reporting them, prioritizing them according to business needs, remediating them through software or procedural changes, verifying that they have been fixed, and documenting lessons learned for the future.</p>
			<p>Note that vulnerability management is not a one-time event. It's an ongoing process that needs to be revisited regularly. New vulnerabilities are discovered all the time, and old ones are fixed or become irrelevant. You need to make sure your systems are always up-to-date and that your patches are current.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we'll cover the following topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a id="_idTextAnchor163"/>Vulnerability analysis – where to start</li>
				<li>Vulnerability classifications</li>
				<li>The life cycle</li>
				<li>Ongoing scanning and monitoring </li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let's dive in!</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-161"><a id="_idTextAnchor164"/>Vulnerability analysis – where to start</h1>
			<p>A vulnerability <a id="_idIndexMarker564"/>assessment is a systematic review of security weaknesses in an information system. Specifically, it looks for vulnerabilities in computer systems, applications, and network infrastructures. It evaluates if the system is susceptible to any known vulnerabilities, assigns severity levels to those vulnerabilities, and recommends remediation, if and whenever it's needed.</p>
			<p>Vulnerability assessments also provide an organization with the necessary knowledge, awareness, and risk backgrounds to understand and react to threats to its environment.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-162"><a id="_idTextAnchor165"/>Vulnerability classifications</h1>
			<p>Vulnerabilities <a id="_idIndexMarker565"/>can be classified into the following categories: </p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Misconfiguration</strong>: You'll hear me preach about this all the time because it's one of the <a id="_idIndexMarker566"/>most common vulnerabilities. Misconfiguration is caused by human error. It allows attackers to gain unauthorized access to your systems. There are different types of misconfigurations because they could happen on application platforms, databases, the network itself, and even web servers. As misconfiguration could occur because someone may have forgotten to update the application or the database. They may have disabled the security settings or some features that are needed, or they may have gone set up permissions incorrectly or misconfigured SSL certificates. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Default installation vulnerabilities</strong>: These are typically done when we hit the <em class="italic">Next</em> options <a id="_idIndexMarker567"/>during installation. I get it. Sometimes, this happens. Installing an application where the attackers and everybody else are expecting it to be and using the same directory structure can create a vulnerability. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Buffer overflows</strong>: These are common software vulnerabilities, and they happen <a id="_idIndexMarker568"/>because of coding errors. What typically happens here is the attacker undermines the functionality of the program and tries to take control of the system by writing content beyond the allocated buffer size. If you overload the buffer, you end up creating a vulnerability, which could be anything from a system crash, the system becoming unstable, or even allowing some programs to do things they normally wouldn't do. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">The server's operating system</strong>: Not <a id="_idIndexMarker569"/>patching the server's <strong class="bold">operating system</strong> (<strong class="bold">OS</strong>) appropriately <a id="_idIndexMarker570"/>may cause a vulnerability. Attackers are always looking or scanning for servers to see if they have them in a patch with the latest and greatest OS. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Design flaws</strong>: These <a id="_idIndexMarker571"/>are caused by either incorrect encryption or junky data validation processes; either the communication or the backend of an app or even a bad design flaw within the network infrastructure itself. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">OS flaws</strong>: I know what you're thinking, and the answer is no, it's not <a id="_idIndexMarker572"/>just limited to Windows. Linux probably has more patches than Microsoft does. But it's because of these types of flaws that attackers can use Trojans, worms, and even viruses to attack those machines. So again, it comes back to patching. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Application flaws</strong>: Research your applications or any mainstream product regarding <a id="_idIndexMarker573"/>what flaws are associated with your applications. You also need to be notified of when those flaws take place, or when they've been discovered. So, update and keep your applications current. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Open services and ports</strong>: Often, we install stuff, and it opens ports or starts up services <a id="_idIndexMarker574"/>or features we may not use on that product or from that application. So, why have it open? Security professionals need to be on a constant lookout and scan the networks or systems for any unnecessary or insecure services or ports. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Default passwords</strong>: It cracks me up how many times people continue to use default passwords <a id="_idIndexMarker575"/>on devices, software, or the OS itself. The reason these are vulnerabilities is that if somebody just wants to get the application installed, they just hit next and take the defaults, and then in those defaults is the default password. They think, "<em class="italic">Oh, I'll change it later</em>" and then they forget, move on from the project, get fired, or someone else takes over. Whatever the case, these default passwords are going to be the bane of our existence. So, please do me a favor – make sure that you keep your passwords secret as you are installing the applications.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now that we've identified potential areas for vulnerabilities to take place, let's look at what vulnerability assessments you should use.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-163"><a id="_idTextAnchor166"/>The benefits of a vulnerability management program (VMP)</h2>
			<p>One of <a id="_idIndexMarker576"/>the reasons some companies skip using a <strong class="bold">vulnerability management program</strong> (<strong class="bold">VMP</strong>) is that they often think <a id="_idIndexMarker577"/>that the devices or services they are currently using are already protecting them. However, we must remember that a firewall strictly does what a firewall is supposed to do, which is to accept or allow connections through, based on the ports or the protocols they are using. The same applies to an antivirus program. It will scan documents or files within our systems to make sure they haven't been infected. We may also have an intrusion detection system in place, but again, that's only looking for active connections. </p>
			<p>However, a VMP looks at the network devices, servers, workstations, and mobile devices and pinpoints weaknesses that need to be fixed or patched. Hopefully, they do this before they get breached. With close to 100 vulnerabilities being announced each week, your organization's network is only as secure as its last vulnerability assessment. </p>
			<p>One of the problems preventing organizations from using a VMP is that the vulnerability scans and the reports they get, as well as the remediation process, can be extremely overwhelming. However, if you look at this from a different perspective, if your team is on top of the remediation process and the scans, those reports will become less intimidating because you're going to be more on top of things. </p>
			<p>An ongoing VMP process, in combination with a proper remediation process, will help you ensure your network is extremely secure and can withstand the latest attacks. </p>
			<p>Here are some of the benefits of a VMP:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A VMP can help identify which risks need to be repaired or fixed. If we thoroughly monitor activity, we will get more information about the systems on our network. This allows us to contextualize all the different nodes or systems listed within the scan report itself. They can make better assessments about what needs to be fixed, when, and how. They also get to know which risks are extremely pressing versus those that aren't as important. </li>
				<li>Time is money. Some argue it takes too much time to perform vulnerability scans and the remediation process. They forget to compare it to the amount of time they spend remediating huge risks that are detected too late or, worse, having to deal with bad press right from the fallout of some type of breach in their environment. By looking at these reports and monitoring what's going on, it becomes clear that this is a huge time saver. It saves you from working every night and weekend because a breach is taking place and you're trying to fix things.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If a company or organization is managing its vulnerabilities effectively, it will spend little time monitoring its systems. When a risk is detected, it can usually be fixed quickly and easily. It also saves you from doing a ton of work in a short time since your systems and network are secure and up to date. </p>
			<ul>
				<li>It improves <a id="_idIndexMarker578"/>security. Organizations that manage vulnerabilities are looking at it as a process, not just a one-time activity. Organizations that consistently and continually monitor their environment, to ensure they're one step ahead of attackers and the threats that are out there, maintain a more secure and safer environment.</li>
				<li>It saves money. This is probably the number one benefit of implementing VMP. It will save you from a costly breach. It's commonplace to see companies hit the news for being breached, and they end up facing huge costs from several different areas. Not only do they need to pay somebody to come in to get things under control, but they may also suddenly have to upgrade their systems or replace different components. And, of course, we can't forget the ominous lawsuits that they may acquire because of the breach. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>As I traveled around the world in the early 2000s doing different workshops for government agencies and training classes with corporate 500 companies, this conversation would take place. I would hear the IT staff saying that they couldn't get the budget to upgrade their OSs or their systems because nobody thought it was important, or that they could get by. Well, that's not the case anymore. And a lot of my customers (and hopefully, you) will change their thought processes. </p>
			<p>Please have your CFO or CTO know that you have two choices: pay for the upgrades now when it's not a mission-critical issue or a breach issue or pay a lot more down the road when that breach takes place. I think that's the mindset or the new norm we need to embrace. It's not a matter of if you get breached, but when. </p>
			<p>Instead of <a id="_idIndexMarker579"/>being reactive to issues that come up, you should look at being proactive. If you know me or have taken any of my courses before, you will know that I'm a big fan of being proactive. </p>
			<p>Now, let's talk about vulnerability assessment types.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-164"><a id="_idTextAnchor167"/>Vulnerability assessments </h2>
			<p>Vulnerability <a id="_idIndexMarker580"/>assessments let you examine the ability of an application or a system – which includes current security procedures and controls – to withstand any type of attack. </p>
			<p>The following <a id="_idIndexMarker581"/>are some advantages of having a good vulnerability assessment process:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>It should identify, measure, and then classify the vulnerabilities. And then, based on the reports, you, as a security professional, will understand how to lock things down. </li>
				<li>During a vulnerability assessment, you should be able to identify weaknesses and classify them based on their importance and severity. You'll also want to classify them based on the type of device they are and/or the communication channels they use.</li>
				<li>It should give you additional security measures or identify those things you need to do to fix some of these weaknesses. </li>
				<li>It should be able to scan for vulnerabilities based on the network.</li>
				<li>It should be able to identify open ports. You will see a lot of crossovers here because the assessment should be able to identify the services that are running, the unnecessary ones, and any application weaknesses. Vulnerability management products will help you identify applications that have not been updated or need to be updated. </li>
				<li>It should be able to identify any service weaknesses. If it's running, we need to make sure the service itself is secure. And typically, it's going to identify services that haven't been patched or faulty because of their design. </li>
				<li>It should <a id="_idIndexMarker582"/>help us identify configuration errors and show us accounts that have weak passwords, no passwords, or haven't changed their passwords in umpteen years. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now, let's look at the different types of vulnerability assessments that are available to us.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-165"><a id="_idTextAnchor168"/>Types of vulnerability assessments </h2>
			<p>There are <a id="_idIndexMarker583"/>different kinds of vulnerability assessments you can run, including the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Active assessments</strong>: These are typically where we use network scanners to scan the <a id="_idIndexMarker584"/>network to identify the hosts, any vulnerabilities on those hosts, all the different nodes, and the services – anything that's on the network. Active network scanners can reduce the intrusiveness of the checks that they perform. So, you can make them extremely loud, or extremely quiet, or stealthy, if you will. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Passive assessments</strong>: This is where we sniff the traffic. So, we're not going after a <a id="_idIndexMarker585"/>specific target – we're just looking at the traffic to see if we can identify active systems, services, or applications, and then try to determine the vulnerabilities present. Now, because we're sniffing the traffic, we should also be able to get a list of users who are currently on the network. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">External assessments</strong>: External assessments are one of the many methods that are <a id="_idIndexMarker586"/>used in ethical hacking. An external assessment means that the assessment is conducted over the internet, generally beginning with a port scan or some other form of network mapping.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The main goal of an external assessment is to locate vulnerabilities in the organization's public web pages and services (if any exist). Once these vulnerabilities have been located, an internal assessment must be performed to exploit them.</p>
			<p>A <a id="_idIndexMarker587"/>common misconception when it comes to external assessments is that they are designed to assess the security of private networks, such as DMZs and internal networks. The vulnerability scan will not reveal vulnerabilities on your internal network if your public web pages are directly connected to your private network. Internal hosts (such as file servers) aren't visible over the internet unless you've opened specific ports and services.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Internal assessments</strong>: This type of assessment looks at everything from an internal <a id="_idIndexMarker588"/>perspective. Internal assessments are typically designed to reveal vulnerabilities on the private network. For this reason, internal assessments typically reveal more risks than external assessments because an attacker would much rather hack into a file server or mail server than try to hack your public web pages.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>There is usually more to the story than simply whether or not a vulnerability was found. For example, an internal assessment may reveal that a web application on your company's website has been identified as having several vulnerabilities. However, this does not give you the whole picture. Perhaps one of those vulnerabilities could be mitigated by changing the default credentials for a database on your website. Since this is a common area of vulnerability, it would be difficult to assess the risk of not changing those default credentials from a vulnerability standpoint alone. </p>
			<p>This is just one example of the nuanced reality of vulnerability assessments. Your organization must assess the risks surrounding each vulnerability to assess their true impact. This is part of what makes an internal assessment so valuable.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Host-based assessments</strong>: You can probably guess what this means, right? Here, we're <a id="_idIndexMarker589"/>going to do a configuration-level check at each of the host machines, whether they're a server or a desktop. The type of thing I want to look at includes whether I can get a hold of a registry and see if it has been incorrectly configured, as well as any file permissions and software configuration issues.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Network assessments</strong>: This shows you vulnerabilities such as unnecessary services, weak <a id="_idIndexMarker590"/>authentication, and missing patches on your desktops, laptops, servers, and the network devices themselves. Is the interface for your switch through HTTP? Is it open? What's authentication mechanism is used? Is there weak encryption? </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Application assessments</strong>: Here, we're looking at apps that are installed everywhere. When I say apps, I'm not just referencing apps on workstations. SQL, Exchange, SharePoint, and WordPress are all examples of apps. Anything that loads <a id="_idIndexMarker591"/>up on the servers is an app and we must make sure it has been patched and configured correctly and is up to date. I've seen something happen a couple of times where a company claims all their systems are up to date, they're strictly running the latest and greatest in Windows, and that they do network scan only to discover they have a host machine running an older version of either an application or an OS. Their reason? "<em class="italic">You see, we don't want to have to pay for the upgrade</em>" or "<em class="italic">The company isn't around anymore</em>." Guess what? It's time to find a different solution unless you want to trend on Twitter for a day or two because you've been breached. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Wireless network assessments</strong>: We use this assessment to test our wireless <a id="_idIndexMarker592"/>networks and try to identify any rogue wireless networks that could be somewhere within your company. These audit client-specific sites with a wireless network. They do this by sniffing the wireless network traffic and trying to crack <a id="_idIndexMarker593"/>the encryption keys. And if I'm able to get in through wireless, then the whole network assessment comes into play, right?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now, let's discuss the life cycle of a vulnerability assessment process.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-166"><a id="_idTextAnchor169"/>The vulnerability life cycle</h1>
			<p>Every time I see the words <em class="italic">life cycle</em>, I think I need to go out and exercise, but the purpose <a id="_idIndexMarker594"/>of the life cycle here is to make sure we follow every step to find solutions and remediate them. In this case, these steps will help us find security weaknesses and remediate them before they become exploits: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer079" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/B17486_06_001.jpg" alt="Figure 6.1 – Vulnerability assessment life cycle" width="709" height="705"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.1 – Vulnerability assessment life cycle</p>
			<p>Here are the steps of the vulnerability life cycle process:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Creating a baseline</strong>: In this phase, we look at critical assets, identify them, and prioritize <a id="_idIndexMarker595"/>them to create a good baseline for vulnerability management. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">The assessment</strong>: This is a critical phase of vulnerability management. What we do, as security professionals, is identify and know the vulnerabilities within our infrastructure. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Risk assessment</strong>: All we're doing here is measuring or summarizing the vulnerability and the risk level – some systems may be at a higher risk level than others. Again, it depends on what their function is and who is operating them. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Remediation</strong>: Remediation is the process of fixing those vulnerabilities based on the risk assessment. We need to know which ones are the most important and then tackle them accordingly.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Verification</strong>: We take this step to make sure we've fixed the issue. It allows the security team to check whether all the phases we've done previously have been followed and if the identified vulnerabilities have been fixed.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Monitoring</strong>: Regular monitoring needs to be performed to help you maintain and always have the lastest updates. This is because a new update will have you create a new baseline where new threats will come out daily. So, we're going to continue monitoring. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now, let's discuss some of the vulnerability assessment solutions that are available.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-167"><a id="_idTextAnchor170"/>Types of vulnerability assessment solutions</h2>
			<p>There are <a id="_idIndexMarker596"/>four types of vulnerability assessment solutions you can look at. They are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Product-based solutions</strong>: These are installed somewhere within your network. They <a id="_idIndexMarker597"/>could be installed in the private or non-routable space, as well as the internet addressable portion of your company's network. The only downside to installing these within your network is that they're going to be behind a firewall, and they can't always detect vulnerabilities on the outside. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Service-based solutions</strong>: These are typically offered by third parties or the consultants <a id="_idIndexMarker598"/>you are using. Some of the solutions are hosted within your organization, such as a cloud-based solution. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Tree-based solutions</strong>: This is a hybrid-type solution. A security professional will <a id="_idIndexMarker599"/>select a particular scanner for scanning services on Windows products, databases, or web servers but then use a different scanner for the Linux boxes. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Inference-based solutions</strong>: Here, we start our scans by building up an inventory <a id="_idIndexMarker600"/>or identifying all the protocols that have been found on a particular machine. Once we've discovered or identified those protocols, the scanning process starts to detect which ports are attached to the services, such as an email server, a database server, or a web server. After it finds these services, it selects the vulnerabilities on each machine and starts to execute the relevant tests. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>The importance of corporate policies cannot be understated, so let's talk about that next.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-168"><a id="_idTextAnchor171"/>Corporate policies and regulations</h2>
			<p>With <a id="_idIndexMarker601"/>corporate policies, our goal is to obtain support for security awareness <a id="_idIndexMarker602"/>within the organization and outline, in general terms, the risks, guidelines, and responsibilities in our environment. Creating and enforcing security policies can help legally because it shows due diligence. The policy needs to stress its goals and responsibilities. Some parts may require technical details, while others may be accessible to everybody within the company. As we create these policies, the guidelines need to be backed up by a detailed technical implementation policy at a departmental or managerial level. </p>
			<p>For example, a network manager can implement a policy to protect data that's passing through the organization's network. Someone in HR could make sure security training is taking place, as well as an awareness program. A firewall administrator could implement a policy to help protect data that's passing through certain ports.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Some parts of the security policy, such as its standards, procedures, and guidelines, should be confidential. It would not be smart to make details of your security system or your DR plan accessible to the public or even to all employees. This information could assist somebody in a malicious attack. </p>
			<p>When it <a id="_idIndexMarker603"/>comes to regulatory environments, some companies and organizations <a id="_idIndexMarker604"/>are bound by laws and regulations that govern the way they store, transmit, and process information, especially if the organization handles sensitive personal information or data from the government. </p>
			<p>Organizations operating with industries such as healthcare or payment card processing must comply with industry regulations. The issue is that a lot of these laws don't prescribe or give any specific information about using a VMP. </p>
			<p>Some examples are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act</strong> (<strong class="bold">HIPAA</strong>): This regulates <a id="_idIndexMarker605"/>how healthcare providers and anybody who interacts with a health care provider insurance company, as well as any business partners that they deal with, store information. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act</strong> (<strong class="bold">GLBA</strong>): This controls how financial institutions handle <a id="_idIndexMarker606"/>customer financial records. None of these laws tell us what type of vulnerability scanning we need to implement. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard</strong> (<strong class="bold">PCIDSS</strong>): This specifies security <a id="_idIndexMarker607"/>controls over transactions for retailers who handle credit cards and service providers partnering in those transactions. The interesting thing is that the majority of people think PCIDSS is a law. Well, it's not. It's simply a standard; you can choose to follow it or not. The ramification of not following it is that the credit card company or your merchant providers could say "<em class="italic">We'll no longer support your transactions.</em>" </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Federal Information Security Management Act</strong> (<strong class="bold">FISMA</strong>): This regulation requires <a id="_idIndexMarker608"/>government agencies and anybody who operates or interacts with the government, or on behalf of the government, to comply with a series of security standards. In the case of PCIDSS, it lists the following as part of the requirements when it comes to a VMP: <ul><li>First, you need to implement VMP. They don't care which one; they don't say you have to use a specific one – they just say you must use one.</li><li>Another requirement PCI specifies is that internal scans must be conducted by a qualified person – somebody who has been trained to do internal and external stuff. The external stuff must be done by someone outside your organization.</li><li>They also specify that organizations must run their scans at least every quarter. Also, anytime you make any major changes to your network, such as adding a new firewall rule or upgrading some networking components in their firmware, you need to make sure everything is still safe. And, between the internal and external scans, these must be done by a qualified person or a vendor – a vendor for the external scans and personnel for the internals. They become qualified by going through a series of steps, including filling in an application and training and enrolling with the PCI Security Standards Council. </li><li>Organizations are also required to remediate any high-risk vulnerabilities as fast as possible. They need to repeat the scan to make sure they've resolved or have a clean system to ensure the fix that was implemented applied the appropriate settings. </li></ul></li>
			</ul>
			<p>A lot of organizations conduct scans to ensure nothing embarrassing shows up before they have an outside vendor come in. As I mentioned previously, FISMA is another regulation out there for government agencies, and they have a list of requirements for organizations that are subject to FISMA. I haven't seen any detailed information about this regulation, except for the fact it applies to government agencies, but some of their requirements are very similar to PCIDSS. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-169"><a id="_idTextAnchor172"/>The scope of scanning </h2>
			<p>When it comes to scopes, we're referencing what the scan looks like regarding the range of hosts <a id="_idIndexMarker609"/>or subnets included within the scan. If you have a large network, it will probably make sense to schedule scans of different portions of the network at different times. This is going to help you reduce the impact of the network's performance and make it easier to analyze the results of each of the scans. </p>
			<p>You may want to devise scans of limited scopes to identify issues or meet a particular compliance goal. Now, I would say there are a few questions you should ask yourself when it comes to scoping out vulnerability scans. </p>
			<p>First, ask, "<em class="italic">What systems and what networks should I include in the vulnerability scan</em>?" Remember, we don't have to scan every system. </p>
			<p>Second, ask, "<em class="italic">What tests will be performed against the systems that are discovered by the vulnerability scan</em>?" This could create some issues for you if you're unprepared for or don't understand what tests are being done within the VMP. </p>
			<p>Third, ask, "<em class="italic">Are the systems online</em>?" That sounds basic, but remember, the information you know about the system is only as good as the last scan you achieved. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-170"><a id="_idTextAnchor173"/>Scanning frequency</h2>
			<p>Defining <a id="_idIndexMarker610"/>our scan frequencies can be limited by several factors, including <a id="_idIndexMarker611"/>the following: </p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Technical constraints</strong>: This is the primary factor. Scanning a Windows workstation for vulnerabilities is typically very low and it can be performed each time the host connects to the network. When it comes to something such as a code review or vulnerability analysis, for customized applications, this must be handled a bit more delicately and it can be a little bit more expensive. So, again, the technical constraints could limit the frequency of scanning. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Scanning the system</strong>: You may only be capable of performing a certain number of scans each day. Your organization may need to adjust the scan frequency to make sure all the scans can complete successfully and within a given time. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Risk appetite</strong>: It's like rolling the dice. For each scan activity, there is a cost that's associated with it. Again, if we look at that customized application, there might be <a id="_idIndexMarker612"/>a policy that dictates a scan or review but only if the overall threat intelligence changes. For example, let's say there's some new code exploit that's been discovered. So, again, the organization's risk appetite is its willingness to tolerate risks within your environment. Let's say, for example, that your company or organization is extremely risk-averse. Well, you may choose to conduct your scans more often to help minimize the amount of time between when the vulnerability becomes something that's of importance or comes into existence. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Regulatory requirements</strong>: Regulations may make it impossible for you to increase your risk appetite. If your company must adhere to certain regulations, especially using scanning controls at predetermined intervals or according to a formal change management process that can affect that schedule because it must be followed.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Workflow</strong>: As an organization develops and improves its security policies and controls, it adopts a more mature security model. As your security capabilities increase, vulnerability management and information security assurance need to be baked into your network management and software development workflows. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Business constraints</strong>: Business constraints may limit your organization because vulnerability scans can be resource-intensive. For example, it may not be in your best interest to scan during periods of high business activity; you want to make sure you try to avoid critical processes from being disrupted. We want to make sure we schedule them to run at the appropriate time.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Licensing</strong>: This can curtail the bandwidth that's consumed by the scanner or even the number of scans that you conduct at the same time. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>As a security professional, you must learn to balance each of these considerations when planning a <a id="_idIndexMarker613"/>vulnerability scanning program. It's best to start small and slowly expand the scope and the frequency over time so that you learn by doing along the way. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-171"><a id="_idTextAnchor174"/>Types of scans</h2>
			<p>There are <a id="_idIndexMarker614"/>different types of scans that our vulnerability scanners or VMPs can do, as follows: </p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Active scan/non-credentialed scans</strong>: This scan proceeds by directing test packets <a id="_idIndexMarker615"/>at a host without being able to <a id="_idIndexMarker616"/>log onto the OS or application. What we get out <a id="_idIndexMarker617"/>of this is a specific view that allows us to see <a id="_idIndexMarker618"/>what the host exposes to the network. These are also referred to as remote scans. Now, even though you're doing a non-credential scan, you could put include things such as default passwords for service accounts in devices. Active scanning also consumes more network bandwidth and runs the risk of crashing a target of the scan, causing some weird results, or even an outage. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Passive scans</strong>: A passive <a id="_idIndexMarker619"/>scanner watches network traffic, usually <a id="_idIndexMarker620"/>through a mirrored port, and tries to identify the policy definition or the CVEs. This type of scanning has the least amount of impact on the network because it's simply sitting there listening, as opposed to a credential scan. This is where you give a user an account with login rights to various hosts. You can specify a username and password. This gives you in-depth analysis, especially when you're detecting when an application or security settings could be misconfigured. It also helps demonstrate if an attacker has compromised one of your user accounts.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Agent scans</strong>: This type <a id="_idIndexMarker621"/>of scan is where we install an <a id="_idIndexMarker622"/>agent on the different stations or targets that we plan on scanning. The agent is simply a piece of software that reports back to a specific server or service and is managed by an administration server. It runs the scans locally and then sends the report at a set schedule to the administrative server. Nessus is a VMP that has an agent that you can install on a Windows host. The biggest advantage here is that agent-based scans help reduce the impact on your network since everything is being done by the agent on the local machine and only the results are reported back. However, one of the drawbacks is that the range of agents could be limited to a particular OS, but most of <a id="_idIndexMarker623"/>them today support all the major OSs. The other disadvantage would be that this is now another application <a id="_idIndexMarker624"/>that you, as a security professional, need to make sure the agents are up to date with so that an attacker can't compromise it and use it to get into your environment. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>We must also worry about scanning levels, which focus more on the sensitivity level. We can do a discovery scan, which is used to create and update your inventory of assets. This is typically done to identify the hosts in the services they're running. </p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Assessment scans</strong>: This <a id="_idIndexMarker625"/>will only contain options for analyzing hosts for vulnerabilities and/or malware. <p class="callout-heading">Important Note</p><p class="callout">A vulnerability can include misconfiguration, as well as software exploits. Typically, an assessment scan will present options for comparing the OS and application settings against a policy template. Another option would be to test for weak passwords or recycled passwords. Note that an assessment scan can create a ton of network traffic, so be very careful.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now, let's talk about scanner maintenance.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-172"><a id="_idTextAnchor175"/>Scanner maintenance</h2>
			<p>Scanner maintenance is a piece of software. As with any technology product, we need to make sure <a id="_idIndexMarker626"/>the VMPs are healthy and strong. We do that by implementing proper care and feeding for that application. Administrators should conduct regular maintenance of their VMP to make sure the scanning software and the vulnerability feeds are up to date. The process of regularly patching and upgrading your VMPs will help protect the organization against scanner-specific vulnerabilities. </p>
			<p>The other thing you need to be worried about is the plugins. A lot of these products allow you to place additional plugins to help you tweak the environment. However, some of these plugins are written by individuals who may not keep them up to date, which, based on future vulnerabilities, could make your system susceptible to an attack. So, administrators should configure their scanners to retrieve the new plugins or their updates. It's even better if you do this daily.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-173"><a id="_idTextAnchor176"/>Classifying data</h2>
			<p>You must recognize what pieces of information are important when you're considering data assets <a id="_idIndexMarker627"/>in your environment and this is going to depend on your situation. For example, blueprints for a jet ski may not be that important if you're a company that rents jet skis out, but if you're the jet ski manufacturer, that is probably a little bit more important and may need to be kept confidential. </p>
			<p>Sometimes, if an attacker gets a hold of your company's organization chart, it not only shows who works for whom but also the more sensitive information. </p>
			<p>So, how do you classify data? Well, that's easy. </p>
			<p>There are four different things you should be looking at, as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Product development, production, and maintenance</strong>: This information could be quite vital to a company. What we often see with breaches is customer contact information being released. Sometimes, this includes financial operations and controls – the collection and payment of debit cards and payroll taxes. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Legal obligations</strong>: Legal obligations help maintain accurate records for a given <a id="_idIndexMarker628"/>period and also contractual obligations to third parties via <strong class="bold">service-level agreements</strong> (<strong class="bold">SLAs</strong>). </li>
			</ul>
			<p>Next, let's look at document management.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-174"><a id="_idTextAnchor177"/>Document management</h2>
			<p>Also known as data handling, this is the process of managing information over its life cycle, all the <a id="_idIndexMarker629"/>way from the creation process to its destruction. At each stage of this life cycle, security considerations are extremely important. Most documents will go through one or more different draft stages before they're published. But as a draft, the document will be subject to a workflow, which helps describe how editorial changes are made or approved. We see a lot of these workflows being created in a Microsoft product called SharePoint. </p>
			<p>The workflow goes through and specifies – and this could be paper-based – who the authors, editors, and reviewers are. </p>
			<p>As part of the creation process, the document must be classified based on how sensitive it is. Now, typically, those classifications are given labels, as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Unclassified</strong>: There <a id="_idIndexMarker630"/>are no restrictions on viewing this document. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Classified</strong>: This is <a id="_idIndexMarker631"/>also known as restricted, private, or for official use only. Viewing is restricted to the owner, organization, or third parties under a non-disclosure agreement. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Confidential</strong>: This is <a id="_idIndexMarker632"/>one of the lower ends of the classifications when we're dealing with some of the higher-end ones, but it's set up so that the information is sensitive and can only be viewed by approved personnel within the organization. We may also want to include an <strong class="bold">non-disclosure agreement</strong> (<strong class="bold">NDA</strong>) here. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Secret</strong>: This is <a id="_idIndexMarker633"/>also called medium. Viewing is restricted because this information is too valuable to permit any risk of it being viewed. Think of it as top-secret information, just like you see in spy movies. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Double secret probation</strong>: This <a id="_idIndexMarker634"/>one is even higher than top secret.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let's talk next about the why it's important to have an ongoing scanning and monitoring process.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-175"><a id="_idTextAnchor178"/>Ongoing scanning and monitoring</h1>
			<p>When it comes to ongoing scanning and continuous monitoring through the cycle – procurement, as well <a id="_idIndexMarker635"/>as replacing, and the issue of new tactics or new threats and techniques being utilized – it's not enough to perform a vulnerability assessment only once. You need to have some type of plan for an ongoing scan. As we mentioned earlier, you need to come up with a schedule and stick to it. </p>
			<p>Continuous security monitor <a id="_idIndexMarker636"/>refers to the process of continual risk assessment. This means we maintain a high level of awareness of the threats that are coming out or have been released into the wild. It also refers to performing routine audits of rights and privileges in real time. </p>
			<p>To truly have a good <a id="_idIndexMarker637"/>understanding of monitoring, you need to create an initial baseline to help identify any variations. You need to compare them. It's kind of like when someone says my system seems to be slow. Well, compared to what? We must have something to compare it to. Having the ability to compare to an initial baseline helps you identify any type of variations that could represent an incident that's taking place and needs to be investigated.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-176"><a id="_idTextAnchor179"/>Understanding which scanner you should use </h2>
			<p>There is a difference between what you may see in the exam and what may be acceptable <a id="_idIndexMarker638"/>in the real world. You must do in-depth research to decide on the best product for you. This is why it's important to understand different vulnerability scanners. </p>
			<p>Again, my goal here is not to tell you exactly which one to use, but to look at the different features and different options you have available to you. Now, typically, a vulnerability scanner is just a type of network mapper that aims to detect whether the network is exposed to any threats. </p>
			<p>There are numerous tools out there that may do other things, such as footprinting and fingerprinting tools, and to some extent, maybe even some password cracking. But when it comes to vulnerability scanners, you want to look for one that is kind of the answer or the suite or the Swiss Army knife to your solution. You're going to want to make sure they do things such as not only mapping out hosts but maybe even detecting the services that are running. </p>
			<p>Now, let's get back to what the core features of a vulnerability scanner or VMP does. It should not only be able to map the network for hosts and detect the services that are running, but they should use techniques such as banner grabbing to scan for things, such as what level the system or the target has been patched, the security configuration, as well <a id="_idIndexMarker639"/>as the policies or network shares, unused user accounts, weak passwords, rogue access points, whether antivirus software has been configured on it, and so on. </p>
			<p>A vulnerability scanner <a id="_idIndexMarker640"/>can be implemented in two different ways – either as software that's installed or as a security appliance. It can either be a VM or actual appliances you can purchase that are rack-mounted. </p>
			<p>There are other types of scanners out there too, including web application vulnerability scanners <a id="_idIndexMarker641"/>that look at specific vulnerabilities in applications, such as SQL injection or <strong class="bold">cross-site scripting</strong> (<strong class="bold">XSS</strong>) software attacks. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-177"><a id="_idTextAnchor180"/>The difference between open source and commercial scanners </h2>
			<p>Most people believe open source is the best because it doesn't cost any money, but we have <a id="_idIndexMarker642"/>some products out there that got their start <a id="_idIndexMarker643"/>as open source and then turned into commercial. Some continue to offer both features. Open source scanners are typically open to anyone who wants to use them, and they are free. Since open source scanning tools are open source, you can also integrate with other open source tools for a more integrated solution. </p>
			<p>Commercial vulnerability scanners offer end-to-end testing that ensures compliance with security standards. This is a good feature for companies that need to make sure their environment is secure and not open to vulnerabilities. Commercial scanners typically provide 24/7 support, while smaller open source scanner companies may only be available during certain hours of the day. </p>
			<p>To decide whether you should use commercial or open source scanners, you need to look at your environment and see what works best for your organization. </p>
			<p>When you're deciding which type of scanner is right for your company, consider these factors: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>How many resources do you have? </li>
				<li>Do you need help with custom scanning features? </li>
				<li>Will you need support (learning or troubleshooting)?</li>
				<li>What types of compliance standards do you need to be able to validate?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>As you can see, there are several reasons why companies may want to consider using either an open source or commercial product when choosing a vulnerability scanner.</p>
			<p>One of <a id="_idIndexMarker644"/>these products is Nessus, produced <a id="_idIndexMarker645"/>by Tenable Network Security. It's one of the better-known commercial vulnerability scanners out there. It's available on-premises via Nessus Manager, as well as in the cloud (the tenable cloud). They also have a professional version that you can run on smaller networks. The product also has a home edition that can be used for free in addition to a paid subscription.</p>
			<p>Nessus started as <a id="_idIndexMarker646"/>an open source product. It provides the source code for many other scanners that are out there. The default scans that you can perform with Nessus use plugins from the Nessus subscription feeds. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-178"><a id="_idTextAnchor181"/>On-premises versus the cloud </h2>
			<p>It's important to understand that not every solution is going to be the best one for your environment. </p>
			<p>On-premises <a id="_idIndexMarker647"/>is something you install and manage yourself. </p>
			<p>When it <a id="_idIndexMarker648"/>comes to the cloud, this is where we still manage but we don't have to worry about keeping things up to date. Most of the time, these products will update themselves as soon as they become aware of certain vulnerabilities. </p>
			<p>We also have to consider databases and where we store them. </p>
			<p>In the case of one vendor, where they install a client on your machine that scans that machine and then uploads it to the database, it's located within the cloud itself. </p>
			<p>Others will keep them on the database in the local machine, and report back. It just depends on which way you want the communication channel to go and how often you want it to go. </p>
			<p>My only problem with relying on the cloud – and this is just a personal thing – is that things can break. For <a id="_idIndexMarker649"/>example, a <strong class="bold">denial-of-service</strong> (<strong class="bold">DoS</strong>) attack can affect your ability to contact your vulnerability scanning cloud provider. So, make sure that you have some backups there.</p>
			<p>Now, when I say everybody's involved, I mean that a lot of people are getting involved in this environment. Google has a cloud security scanner that's available to you. It's called the Amazon inspector. There's also Retina, which is owned by Beyond Trust. They have a cloud vulnerability assessment. I've used an on-premises version of Retina and I enjoyed it. Nessus <a id="_idIndexMarker650"/>had something called tenable I/O, which is their cloud solution. McAfee also has a <strong class="bold">security as a service</strong> (<strong class="bold">SaaS</strong>) concept. </p>
			<p>We also <a id="_idIndexMarker651"/>have Secure Works, which has a nice interface to it. Alien Vault <a id="_idIndexMarker652"/>is another product that's out there as well. We also have Koalas, a cloud-based service that is probably one of the most popular and it's a great solution. Users install sensor agents on various points in their network, and the sensors upload data to the cloud platform for analysis. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-179"><a id="_idTextAnchor182"/>Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP)</h2>
			<p>A developing area of security analysis and threat intelligence is the correlation of information <a id="_idIndexMarker653"/>that's produced by different security tools, such as vulnerability scanners and IDS systems. </p>
			<p>SCAP allows <a id="_idIndexMarker654"/>compatible scanners to determine whether the computer meets a particular configuration baseline. To learn more about the specifications for SCAP, you can visit <a href="https://scap.nist.gov">scap.nist.gov</a>. Yes, it's a government thing. </p>
			<p>The MITRE corporation helped develop some of the key components of SCAP, which can be used on multiple scanning or vulnerability devices. It developed dictionaries of identifiers that are used in the NIST vulnerability database. These identifiers give us a standard means for identifying products to refer to in a vulnerability or a platform very consistently. </p>
			<p>Some of these identifiers are as follows: </p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Common Vulnerability Exposures</strong> (<strong class="bold">CVEs</strong>): This <a id="_idIndexMarker655"/>identifier <a id="_idIndexMarker656"/>helps identify cyber security vulnerabilities in published OSs and application software. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">The Common Platform Enumeration</strong> (<strong class="bold">CPE</strong>): This <a id="_idIndexMarker657"/>is also maintained by the <strong class="bold">National Institute of Standards and Technology</strong> (<strong class="bold">NIST</strong>) and deals with <a id="_idIndexMarker658"/>OSs, applications, and hardware devices. If you need some common best practices <a id="_idIndexMarker659"/>statements, that's <a id="_idIndexMarker660"/>where the <strong class="bold">Society of Corporate Compliance &amp; Ethics</strong> (<strong class="bold">SCCE</strong>) comes into play. It's the common configuration enumeration. </li>
				<li> <strong class="bold">Common Weakness Enumeration</strong> (<strong class="bold">CWE</strong>): In <a id="_idIndexMarker661"/>addition to these identifiers, SCAP <a id="_idIndexMarker662"/>uses several other components. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language</strong> (<strong class="bold">OLA</strong>): This is good If you're <a id="_idIndexMarker663"/>looking for flaws <a id="_idIndexMarker664"/>in the designs and development of software that could potentially lead to vulnerabilities. This is an XML schema that is used to describe a system's security states and query vulnerability reports and other information that is too detailed for now. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format</strong>: This is also an XML <a id="_idIndexMarker665"/>schema, but it's <a id="_idIndexMarker666"/>for developing and auditing best practice configuration checklists and rules. In the old days, best practices guides were written for administrators to apply manually. This component provides a machine-readable format that can be applied and validated using compatible software. If you're asking yourself, "<em class="italic">How do these vulnerability scanners know how to fix themselves</em>?" it's because of these components and identifiers. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Common Vulnerability Scoring System</strong> (<strong class="bold">CVSS</strong>): This is now maintained by <a id="_idIndexMarker667"/>the Forum <a id="_idIndexMarker668"/>of Incident Response and Security Teams. CDSS is a means of linking vulnerabilities to a standard metric. So, we understand how important certain vulnerabilities are. The metrics generate a score from 0-10 based on the inherent characteristics of the vulnerability, as well as the environment where the exposure occurs and the changing characteristics of the vulnerability over time. The higher the score, the more critical the issue is.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-180"><a id="_idTextAnchor183"/>Exploit scanners</h2>
			<p>When it comes to exploits scanners, most of our vulnerability scanning software uses non-intrusive <a id="_idIndexMarker669"/>scanning techniques. Non-intrusive <a id="_idIndexMarker670"/>scans use network fingerprinting and banner grabbing or allow the agent to read the system configuration as files pass through or even from log files. These normally don't cause any performance problems for the server or the host, but they can return a high number of false positives. </p>
			<p>We also have intrusive scanning techniques, which usually involve an attempt to exploit a detected vulnerability. One of the most well-known exploit frameworks out there is Metasploit, an open source platform that's maintained by Rapid7. </p>
			<p>The free edition is a Community Edition that comes as a package for both Linux and Windows. Being a framework, it has a ton of tools that allow us to discover hosts and their vulnerabilities, and then identify or create exploit modules to target those vulnerabilities. Metasploit can use Nmap or its tools. Again, since it's a framework, it can connect to vulnerability scanners such as OpenVAS, Nessus, or Nexpose. We can also have and implement a key scanner to help us open a reverse shell so that we gain full access to the directory structure of the target system that's using those vulnerabilities. </p>
			<p>A common technique a lot of these exploit frameworks use is fuzzing, which involves sending invalid or random data to the application to test its ability to handle unexpected data. That application is then monitored to see if it crashes, fails, or responds incorrectly. One of the most advanced commercial fuzzers out there is Peach Fuzzer. It has a free-to-use community edition, plus a professional and enterprise edition with different licensing models. The platform is supplemented with what they call peach pits, which are different packs (add-ins). Microsoft used to have fuzzers too, but they no longer make those available for download. Instead, Microsoft is moving to a cloud-based fuzzing service that is codenamed project Springfield. </p>
			<p>So, you have your scan report, and it has a big list of vulnerabilities that it's detected. Normally, these <a id="_idIndexMarker671"/>vulnerabilities will be associated with a <strong class="bold">Common Vulnerability Scoring System</strong> (<strong class="bold">CVSS</strong>) score. It's designed to give you a very basic way of prioritizing the response actions. You should review the whole report and try to identify – from your own experience and knowledge – whether the vulnerability has been overrated or underrated. </p>
			<p>The results <a id="_idIndexMarker672"/>of most of the vulnerability reports will be relatively straightforward for us. Perhaps the system hasn't been receiving updates, or you investigate it by looking at the event logs. The job of an analyst is to spot something that's out of place or a bit odd and then investigate the cause. Part of your job is to try to see if you can make things less confusing by looking at the following tips: </p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Reconcile the results</strong>: Vulnerability scanners can misinterpret the information they get back from the different probes they've sent out. If you can't reconcile a particular issue that you've found, you may want to consider running a scan using a different software product to try to confirm the results. You should also review logs, as well as any other data sources. If you're having trouble linking a vulnerability report to a particular host, or even a software application, use the logs on the host that's associated with that IP to correlate the results – perhaps an application was present during the scan and since then, it has been uninstalled. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Compare the best practices</strong>: Some of the scanners that you may use will measure systems and configuration settings against best practice frameworks. This might be necessary for regulatory compliance, or you may want to conform to your own external agreed standards of a best practice. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>The only issue might be that some compliance scans may return results that are not high priority or might be considered low risk. For example, maybe you've scanned a Windows 8 machine and there are some .NET Framework versions or browsers that are no longer supported. To remediate this type of problem, you would run the Windows update and ensure that the Windows update has been scheduled for future updates. You'd also want to investigate upgrading the Windows 8 machine to a more current version, then run the scan again, and work off any of the items that you find on your list. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-181"><a id="_idTextAnchor184"/>Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) </h2>
			<p>The concept <a id="_idIndexMarker673"/>here is that the analyst must identify and assess vulnerabilities across several different types of hardware and software platforms that may be inside their network. They must also prioritize these vulnerabilities and remediate those that pose the greatest risk first.</p>
			<p>However, when there's a ton of things to fix, each being scored using different scales, how does an analyst then convert this mountain of information into actionable information? Well, that's where CVSS comes into play. It's an open framework that addresses this issue and offers many benefits. </p>
			<p>Let's discuss some of those benefits.</p>
			<h3>Ranking</h3>
			<p>Think of <a id="_idIndexMarker674"/>this as a system that rates your environment, which it does through a standard vulnerability score. When an organization normalizes vulnerability scores across its software and hardware platforms, it can leverage a single vulnerability management policy. This policy is like a SLA in that it tells us how quickly a particular vulnerability must be validated and fixed. </p>
			<p>It's also important to note that when an environmental score is computed, the vulnerability becomes contextual, meaning that the vulnerability score is now representative of its risk to an organization. The scoring schema is based on several different things. </p>
			<h3>The base metrics</h3>
			<p>Base metrics <a id="_idIndexMarker675"/>include things such as exploitability. This metric measures the current state of an exploit technique. If the exploit code itself is publicly available and easy to use, the number of potential attackers also increases. </p>
			<p>When you think of exploitability, you need to think about the attack vector, the complexity of the attack itself, the privileges and the type of user interaction required, and if the user has to click on an email for this attack to take place.</p>
			<h3>The scope metrics</h3>
			<p>This refers to a collection of privileges that's been defined by a computing authority, such as <a id="_idIndexMarker676"/>your application or the OS itself, when granting access to computer resources, such as memory or CPU. These permissions are assigned based on a method of identification and authorization. In some cases, you may find that authorization is easy or nonexistent. For example, if you have Ethernet traffic that's sent to a network switch, the switch accepts the traffic that arrives at its ports, and it's authorized to control the traffic flow to other switch ports. </p>
			<h3>Impact metrics</h3>
			<p>Impact <a id="_idIndexMarker677"/>metrics refer to the properties of the impacted component. Regardless, a successful exploit vulnerability affects one or more components. The impact metric is scored according to the components that suffer the worst or that are most directly and predictably impacted. </p>
			<p>Analysts should constrain impacts to a reasonable outcome they can be confident an attacker can achieve. </p>
			<h3>Temporal metrics </h3>
			<p>This <a id="_idIndexMarker678"/>measures the current state of an exploit technique, the existence of any patches or workarounds, as well as the confidence that you have in describing the vulnerability. What we mean by this is that we look at the likelihood of a vulnerability being attacked. It's based on the current state of that exploit, regardless of updates.</p>
			<p>Let's look at the WannaCry outbreak of 2017. What's interesting is that this vulnerability had low temporal metrics because Microsoft had patched it months before it became popular. </p>
			<p>When it comes to the exploit code's maturity, I go back to that reference of real-world exploration to see that it may only be theoretical. Again, we may see a proof of concept come across. This doesn't necessarily mean that this vulnerability will be used against you. </p>
			<p>Temporal <a id="_idIndexMarker679"/>metrics also include the remediation level of the vulnerability. You need to be able to prioritize that. Typically, the vulnerability is unpatched when it's initially published. The vendors may issue hotfixes or workarounds until an official patch on upgrades has been issued. This happens almost every day.</p>
			<h3>The report confidence </h3>
			<p>This <a id="_idIndexMarker680"/>metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of a vulnerability and how credible the vulnerability is. A lot of times, we see these vulnerabilities come out, and people announce that they are present but nobody publishes specific details. So, its confidence is not very high. Later, the vulnerability may be confirmed and acknowledged by the author or the vendor, which would raise the urgency of that vulnerability to a higher level when it becomes known to exist with certainty. </p>
			<h3>The environmental metrics </h3>
			<p>This metric allows an analyst to customize their CVSS scoring based on how much the IT person <a id="_idIndexMarker681"/>feels it's important for their organization. They do that through things such as security requirements. Again, this is exactly what it sounds like: what security requirements do your company policies specify? What are the security requirements for a regulation that's out there? For example, if an IT asset supports a business function where availability is important, the analysts can assign a greater value to the availability relative to confidentiality and integrity. Each of these security requirements falls under one of three categories: low, medium, or high. </p>
			<h3>Modified base metrics </h3>
			<p>This <a id="_idIndexMarker682"/>enables the analyst to adjust the base matrix according to the modifications that exist within their environment. A great example of this is if an environment has made a general change for some software in the way that it would affect the exploitability, the scope, or the impact. Then, the environment can reflect this via the modification of the base matrix. </p>
			<p>The cool thing about this is that the VMPs consider these CVSSs for us and will help you along the way. </p>
			<h3>False positives and exceptions</h3>
			<p>So, how do we identify false positives and exceptions? Many of the vulnerability reports that we <a id="_idIndexMarker683"/>get will contain numerous false positives or some <em class="italic">you're right, you're wrong</em> results. These are extremely time-consuming to investigate and eliminate. If there are substantial numbers of false positives, you probably need to tune and tweak your scan so that you can reduce the number of false positives that you're getting. </p>
			<p>So, how do we do that? Well, we can start looking at validating applications that could be creating traffic that might be incorrectly matching a scanner signature for vulnerability. In this case, you can add it to your exception list so that you don't look at that particular result again. </p>
			<p>Another issue is that the scanner could be using a heuristic analysis, which might be confused by a valid change in network usage. In other words, it might be necessary to establish new baselines to refer to. </p>
			<p>Another issue that may pop up is that you might be running scans that aren't appropriate for your network – for example, running an application vulnerability scan when your network doesn't run that application. One of the things you should do is try adjusting the scope of the scan so that you are testing for the appropriate applications within your network infrastructure. </p>
			<p>Finally, we have the issue that the scanner might be identifying vulnerabilities that could be exploited with administrative privileges, and not by end users. Now, one of the cool things you can do – especially with most of the VMPs out there – to reduce the incidence of false positives you get is identify the exception in the scan and configure it in a template. This may mean that you're going to exclude certain hosts from certain types of scans or continue to report the vulnerability but just assign it a lower priority. If you have systems that can't be patched or remediated, then you may want to watch those systems a little more closely. </p>
			<p>Next, let's look at how, as a security professional, you can make sure you stay up to date with what's going on in the threat world.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-182"><a id="_idTextAnchor185"/>Trends</h2>
			<p>One of the problems <a id="_idIndexMarker684"/>with security is doing things to create the illusion you have control. I do this all the time with my kids; they assume I know more than I do. </p>
			<p>Normally, you're going to deploy controls that help identify infected or unpatched systems and give you a report that you can work off. This type of activity is good but in the back of your mind, you should be concerned that something else could be sneaking up on you without your knowledge. That's where trends come into play. </p>
			<p>If you monitor the key matrix over a certain period, it should show you policies that aren't being applied or that an attacker is beginning to mount an extremely complex or multistage campaign against you. </p>
			<p>The problem with trends is selecting which matrix to analyze and investigate, given the limited amount of time you have on your hands. Here, you should develop a metrics analysis program. You should also try to make sure it evaluates the effectiveness of each matrix you track. </p>
			<p>Some of <a id="_idIndexMarker685"/>the possible areas for us to analyze are as follows: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Looking at the number of incidences and detections, as well as the response time. </li>
				<li>Looking at hours lost or that were impacted in terms of costs. </li>
				<li>Looking at the network itself or its metrics – you can measure any number of issues here. You can look at the volume of internal and external traffic, the number of logins, the failure of logins, active ports, the number of authorized or unauthorized devices on your network, unauthorized software, and so on. These types of stats may only be interesting from a security perspective and that's because most networks will change – that is, they will get faster as they deploy new equipment and new cabling. You should focus on training as well as threat awareness education – how well is your staff informed about cyber threats? You can measure the number of programs or start grading your users based on their knowledge. We see a lot of this today with the companies that help you create emails that are designed for users to click on a link, and then a trunk monkey pops out and smacks them on the head. </li>
				<li>Looking at compliance. This is great – you've got all these rules and policies in place, but how many of them are being met? What is the percentage? Is it going up or down? Is it going down because the compliant targets are increasing? Or maybe the compliance is getting tougher to meet? Or maybe your policies are not being followed correctly? </li>
				<li>Looking at <a id="_idIndexMarker686"/>the external or outside threat levels – you need to ask yourself what your security looks like out on the internet in general terms. Are we seeing anything popping up and other companies or other competitors that are out there or anybody within our industry? Are there any major new threats for you to start looking for? When I get up in the morning and I start reviewing all my security websites, threads, and RSS feeds, I think to myself, does this apply to me? If it does, I need to include that in my scan so that I can make sure that I'm not vulnerable. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now, because I love you all, I will mention some of those feeds I review all the time: </p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">The SANS Institute</strong>: They have a full training environment, but they also have tons <a id="_idIndexMarker687"/>of information about vulnerabilities that are out there and what's happening.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Dark Reading</strong>: As their <a id="_idIndexMarker688"/>name suggests, their articles are about hacking, which is kind of cool. They cover everything, from the cloud to mobile, to the current breaches and attacks that are taking place. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Microsoft's Windows Defender Security Intelligence</strong>: They mostly focus on <a id="_idIndexMarker689"/>Microsoft-based stuff, but they will also give you some updates concerning some other attack threats that are out there. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">FireEye</strong>: This is <a id="_idIndexMarker690"/>a great resource for you to use. One of their most popular resources is the recent zero-day exploits, which goes through and shows you some of the more popular ones. They also have a great resource of annual reports, as well as threat intelligence reports. You can also subscribe to their threat research blog if you'd like. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Alien Vault</strong>: What <a id="_idIndexMarker691"/>you'll see with most of these is that most of the companies have ulterior motives because they have a product they're trying to sell. However, they still provide a lot of really cool information. When it comes to Alien Vault, they have a threat intelligence digest. All you have to do is sign up for it and you will start getting notifications as new breaches or security threats become available. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Symantec</strong>: They <a id="_idIndexMarker692"/>also have a website for security intelligence that provides tons of information. Typically, what you'll find is that if one vendor knows about the breach or threat, most of them will also be aware of it too. So, sometimes, the information is just repetitive. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Secure Works</strong>: While this company offers some services, they also provide a lot of <a id="_idIndexMarker693"/>information about threats for free under their insights. They have a knowledge center, as well as research and a blog that you can look at. For example, under the <strong class="bold">Research</strong> category, you can go to <strong class="bold">Threat Analysis</strong> and see what's currently going on in that area.</li>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-183"><a id="_idTextAnchor186"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we discussed the benefits of a VMP. We looked at ongoing VMP processes and the importance of vulnerability research, which helps ensure the network is extremely secure and can withstand attacks.</p>
			<p>Then, we discussed how to ID targets for scanning, how often, how deep, and what scope to scan targets with, as well as the different levels of configuration. We also covered classifying data so that when an incident occurs, you'll know what needs to take priority when it comes to fixing the issue. We reviewed which scanner to use based on your environment. We also reviewed ways we can remediate our network vulnerabilities. We also talked about SSL and TLS, making sure that our certificates are valid, and that we're using a strong enough cipher for this encryption. We also talked about the issues with virtualization.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we'll dive into how to attack the targets that we've identified.</p>
