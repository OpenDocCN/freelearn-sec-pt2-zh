    information to use it for malicious purposes. By using social engineering to take
    advantage of people, attackers can breach an organization''s sensitive information
    even with security policies in place. Employees are often unaware of security

    service-desk or help-desk personnel by tricking them into divulging confidential
    information about the organization. To extract information, such as a phone number
    or password, the attacker first wins the trust of the individual with the information.
    On winning their trust, the attacker manipulates them to get valuable information.
    Receptionists and help-desk staff may readily share information if they feel they
    are doing so to help a customer.'

    they know the organization's frontline contacts, such as security guards, receptionists,

    themselves to not be overly suspicious, and they associate specific behaviors
    and appearances with known entities.

    they come across these websites and believe the fake testimonials. Furthermore,
    attackers may install malware alongside the malicious goods if people download
    it.

    by controlling the information supplied to victims.'

    enticing them to buy the goods by clicking on a link supplied in the email. The

    make the required decision within the allotted time may result in the loss of
    critical data.

    certain irregularities, such as the victim''s machine sending out strange errors.
    The attacker establishes confidence by making use of the name of the company and
    their experience in the field of security. Once trust is established, the attacker
    instructs the victim with steps on how to proceed. The attacker then sends a malicious

    concept is that a favor begets a favor, even if the original *favor* is given

    makes money off the information by impersonating someone and using caller ID spoofing.
    Vishing frequently includes prerecorded communications and instructions that appear
