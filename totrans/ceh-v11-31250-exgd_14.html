			<h1 id="_idParaDest-463"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor478"/>Chapter 15</em>: Cloud Computing</h1>
			<p>Cloud computing is a new technology that allows you to access computer applications, data storage, and webmail over the internet. The use of cloud computing enables a decentralized workforce while lowering operational costs and offering data security. Many organizations nowadays are moving their data and infrastructure to the cloud due to these advantages. However, the cloud environment likewise contains several dangers and risks for businesses. Attackers are exploiting security flaws in the cloud software to gain unlawful access to valuable data that is kept there.</p>
			<p>Cloud security is becoming increasingly important for both individuals and organizations. This chapter explains the various methods for attacking the cloud environment, which highlights underlying vulnerabilities. Understanding these assaults and vulnerabilities assists <strong class="bold">Cloud Service Providers</strong> (<strong class="bold">CSPs</strong>) as well as cloud consumers in developing secure cybersecurity measures to safeguard their cloud infrastructures. Remember, this chapter isn't designed to be <em class="italic">this is all you need to know about cloud technologies</em>, but rather how to protect them.</p>
			<p>We'll cover the following topics in this chapter:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Living on Cloud 9</li>
				<li><a id="_idTextAnchor479"/>Attacking the cloud</li>
				<li>Tools and techniques of the attackers</li>
				<li>Best practices for securing the cloud</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let's first lay a foundation for the concepts of cloud computing.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-464"><a id="_idTextAnchor480"/>Living on Cloud 9</h1>
			<p>Cloud computing is <a id="_idIndexMarker2323"/>an on-demand delivery of IT capabilities, in which IT infrastructure and applications are provided to subscribers as metered services over networks. Examples of cloud solutions include Gmail, Facebook, Dropbox, and <a href="http://salesforce.com">salesforce.com</a>.</p>
			<p>Cloud services <a id="_idIndexMarker2324"/>are delivered using internet technologies, which can include public, private, or hybrid models. Let's look at these briefly next:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Public cloud services</strong>: These are offered by providers such as Amazon, Google, and <a id="_idIndexMarker2325"/>Microsoft. These services <a id="_idIndexMarker2326"/>are available to the public and can be used by anyone who registers for an account. The provider manages the infrastructure and applications and makes them available on a pay-as-you-go basis.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Private cloud services</strong>: These are offered by organizations such as IBM, Hewlett-Packard, and Rackspace. These services are used by the organization that owns <a id="_idIndexMarker2327"/>them and are not available to the public. The <a id="_idIndexMarker2328"/>provider manages the infrastructure and applications and makes them available on a pay-as-you-go basis.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Hybrid cloud services</strong>: This is a combination of public and private cloud services. For <a id="_idIndexMarker2329"/>example, an organization <a id="_idIndexMarker2330"/>might use a public cloud service for email and a private cloud service for storage.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Multi-cloud services</strong>: Multi-cloud is another one. It's a cloud environment made up <a id="_idIndexMarker2331"/>of two or more clouds (private, public, or community) that remain unique entities and yet are linked to provide the benefits of <a id="_idIndexMarker2332"/>various deployment methods. The company in this scenario makes some assets internally available and manages them, while other resources are external and handled by others. A great example of this is Microsoft's Azure or Zymr.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let's discuss some of the different cloud computing models next.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-465"><a id="_idTextAnchor481"/>Cloud computing models</h2>
			<p>To meet <a id="_idIndexMarker2333"/>the different needs businesses have, there are a few cloud computing models used. Let's briefly discuss these next:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Software as a Servi<a id="_idTextAnchor482"/>ce</strong> (<strong class="bold">SaaS</strong>): Saas is the most common model for delivering <a id="_idIndexMarker2334"/>cloud services. With SaaS, the provider hosts the applications and makes them available <a id="_idIndexMarker2335"/>to subscribers over the internet. The subscriber uses a web browser to access the applications and does not need to install any software. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>The application is available on a pay-as-you-go basis from the provider. SaaS is a great option for organizations that want to outsource their application hosting and don't want to worry about managing the infrastructure.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Platform as a Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">PaaS</strong>): PaaS is a model for delivering cloud services in which <a id="_idIndexMarker2336"/>the provider hosts <a id="_idIndexMarker2337"/>the infrastructure and makes it available to subscribers over the internet. A subscriber can access the application via a web browser. There is no need to install any software. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>The application is available from the supplier on a pay-as-you-go basis. PaaS is a wonderful alternative for companies who want to outsource their application hosting and don't want to deal with infrastructure management.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Infrastructure as a Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">IaaS</strong>): IaaS is also a model available to subscribers <a id="_idIndexMarker2338"/>over the internet. A provider <a id="_idIndexMarker2339"/>hosts the infrastructure and a subscriber uses a web browser to access the application. There is no need to install any software. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>This application is also available on a pay-as-you-go basis. IaaS is an excellent choice for companies who want to outsource their application hosting but don't want to deal with the infrastructure.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Identity-as-a-Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">IDaaS</strong>): Organizations subscribe to a cloud computing service <a id="_idIndexMarker2340"/>that provides <a id="_idIndexMarker2341"/>authentication services and is run by a third-party provider for identity and access management services. It's a SaaS <a id="_idIndexMarker2342"/>product <a id="_idIndexMarker2343"/>that provides <strong class="bold">Single Sign-On</strong> (<strong class="bold">SSO</strong>), <strong class="bold">Multi-Factor Authentication</strong> (<strong class="bold">MFA</strong>), <strong class="bold">Identity Governance and Administration</strong> (<strong class="bold">IGA</strong>), access management, and <a id="_idIndexMarker2344"/>intelligence gathering. These features allow customers to have more secure access to sensitive data both on and off-premises.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Security-as-a-Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">SECaaS</strong>): In this cloud computing model, security services <a id="_idIndexMarker2345"/>are incorporated into company infrastructure in a cost-effective manner. It is based on SaaS and does not necessitate <a id="_idIndexMarker2346"/>any physical hardware or equipment. As a result, it has significant cost savings over what organizations spend when they create their own security capabilities. It offers services such as penetration testing, authentication, intrusion detection, anti-malware protection, and security incident response.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Container-as-a-Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">CaaS</strong>): The cloud computing architecture behind it enables <a id="_idIndexMarker2347"/>subscribers to utilize containers and clusters as a service. Through a web portal or an <a id="_idIndexMarker2348"/>API, it offers virtualization of container engines, container management, applications, and clusters. Subscribers may use these tools to create rich, scalable containerized applications in the cloud or on-premises data centers. CaaS combines the features of IaaS and PaaS.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Function-as-a-Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">FaaS</strong>): The goal of this cloud computing service is to make <a id="_idIndexMarker2349"/>it simpler to design, operate, and manage <a id="_idIndexMarker2350"/>application features without the burden of having to build and maintain infrastructure (serverless architecture). This architecture is widely utilized in the creation of microservice applications. Consumers access on-demand features, which power off the supporting infrastructure and incur no costs when idle. IoT services, mobile <a id="_idIndexMarker2351"/>and web applications, and batch-and-stream processing are just a few of the data <a id="_idIndexMarker2352"/>processing services it offers.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Whew! I think <a id="_idIndexMarker2353"/>that's all of them. Oh, I guess there is <strong class="bold">Hacking-as-a-Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">HaaS</strong>). Although it's kind of a new concept, basically you pay hackers to <a id="_idIndexMarker2354"/>phish for you or set up a <strong class="bold">Distributed Denial of service</strong> (<strong class="bold">DDoS</strong>) as a service and even just plain old <em class="italic">hire a hacker</em>. I know, crazy right?</p>
			<p>Let's talk about the separation of responsibilities in cloud computing next.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-466"><a id="_idTextAnchor483"/>Separation of responsibilities in cloud computing</h2>
			<p>Not all <a id="_idIndexMarker2355"/>cloud computing models are the same. They differ in the way they distribute the responsibilities of delivering a cloud service. </p>
			<p>The following three models illustrate how this distribution can take place:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>In a <strong class="bold">provider-managed model</strong>, the provider is responsible for everything from <a id="_idIndexMarker2356"/>managing the applications to handling all customer support. </li>
				<li>In a <strong class="bold">self-managed model</strong>, the customer is responsible for managing the applications <a id="_idIndexMarker2357"/>and for handling customer support.</li>
				<li>In a <strong class="bold">hybrid model</strong>, a combination <a id="_idIndexMarker2358"/>of provider-managed and self-managed services is used. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>Which model you choose depends on the needs of your organization. </p>
			<p>Provider-managed services are a good option for organizations that want the provider to handle all the responsibilities, while self-managed services are a good option for organizations that want more control over their applications. If you're not sure which model is right for you, hybrid services are a good option because they offer the best of both worlds.</p>
			<p>Next, we'll talk about how we deploy a cloud service.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-467"><a id="_idTextAnchor484"/>Deployment models</h2>
			<p>Once you've <a id="_idIndexMarker2359"/>decided on the type of cloud <a id="_idIndexMarker2360"/>service you want, you need to decide on the deployment model. </p>
			<p>The following four models are the most common ones:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Public cloud model</strong>: The provider in this model is responsible for the development <a id="_idIndexMarker2361"/>and constant maintenance of the public cloud and its IT resources since they make services such as apps, servers, and data storage available to the public over the internet. As a result, the provider is accountable for creating and maintaining these elements of the public cloud.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Private cloud model</strong>: A private cloud, sometimes <a id="_idIndexMarker2362"/>called an <strong class="bold">internal</strong> or <strong class="bold">corporate</strong> cloud, is a <a id="_idIndexMarker2363"/>cloud infrastructure <a id="_idIndexMarker2364"/>run by a single company and set inside the company's firewall. Organizations build private cloud infrastructures to maintain complete control of corporate data. This model utilizes software such as VMware, SAP, or Microsoft's System Center platform.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Community cloud model</strong>: A community cloud is a type of private cloud that is shared <a id="_idIndexMarker2365"/>by several organizations that have common <a id="_idIndexMarker2366"/>interests, such as ensuring their data remains secure or sharing the cost of infrastructure.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Hybrid cloud model</strong>: A hybrid <a id="_idIndexMarker2367"/>cloud is a composition of two or more clouds (private, community, or public) that <a id="_idIndexMarker2368"/>remain unique entities but are bound together by standardized or proprietary technology that enables data and application portability between them.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Organizations use hybrid clouds to extend the reach of their private clouds into the public cloud, to take advantage of the economies of scale available in public clouds, or to combine the strengths of two or more clouds. Which deployment model is right for you depends on your specific needs. </p>
			<p>Let's talk about the use of container technology next.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-468"><a id="_idTextAnchor485"/>Container technology</h2>
			<p>This emerging <a id="_idIndexMarker2369"/>technology has been developed to specifically address the needs of cloud deployments. It addresses the issue of portability by encapsulating an application and all its dependencies into a self-sufficient package that can be run on any platform, in any environment.</p>
			<p>Some of the <a id="_idIndexMarker2370"/>features of containers include the following: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>They are portable, so they can be run on any platform or infrastructure. </li>
				<li>They are fast to deploy, so you can get your applications up and running quickly. </li>
				<li>They are lightweight, so they don't use a lot of system resources. </li>
				<li>They are secure because all the application's dependencies are included in the container, so you don't have to worry about security issues.</li>
				<li>They are easy to manage because you can track all the containers in your deployment and manage them as a group.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Container technology is still emerging, but it has already gained a lot of traction in the cloud computing world because of its many benefits. If you're looking for a way to make your cloud deployments more portable and efficient, you should consider using containers.</p>
			<p>Let's discuss cloud storage architecture next.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-469"><a id="_idTextAnchor486"/>Cloud storage architecture</h2>
			<p>Now that we <a id="_idIndexMarker2371"/>have a basic understanding of how cloud-based systems work, let's look at the different components that make up a cloud storage system. There are three primary components: <strong class="bold">frontend, middleware, and backend</strong>.</p>
			<p>The frontend layer is the part of the system that the end user interacts with. This might include a web interface or a mobile app. The frontend communicates with the middleware, which is responsible for managing the interaction between the frontend and the backend. The backend is the part of the system that stores the data.</p>
			<p>The frontend and the backend might be in different data centers, and the middleware might be in a third data center. This configuration allows the system to scale by adding more frontends or backends.</p>
			<p>Most cloud <a id="_idIndexMarker2372"/>storage systems use a client/server architecture. The client is the part of the system that is installed on the user's computer. The server is the part of the system that stores the data.</p>
			<p>The client/server architecture allows the system to scale by adding more clients or servers. </p>
			<p>Let's talk next about some of the cloud storage services that are available to us.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-470"><a id="_idTextAnchor487"/>Cloud storage services</h2>
			<p>Now that <a id="_idIndexMarker2373"/>we have a basic understanding of cloud storage, let's look at some of the most popular cloud storage services.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Amazon S3</strong> is a cloud <a id="_idIndexMarker2374"/>storage service that allows <a id="_idIndexMarker2375"/>you to store data in the cloud. The service is based <a id="_idIndexMarker2376"/>on the <strong class="bold">Amazon Web Services</strong> (<strong class="bold">AWS</strong>) platform. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Azure Blob Storage</strong> is a <a id="_idIndexMarker2377"/>cloud storage service that allows <a id="_idIndexMarker2378"/>you to store data in the cloud. The service is based on the Azure platform. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Google Cloud Storage</strong> is a <a id="_idIndexMarker2379"/>cloud storage <a id="_idIndexMarker2380"/>service that allows you to store data <a id="_idIndexMarker2381"/>in the cloud. The service is based on the <strong class="bold">Google Cloud Platform</strong> (<strong class="bold">GCP</strong>). </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">IBM Cloud Object Storage</strong> is a <a id="_idIndexMarker2382"/>cloud storage <a id="_idIndexMarker2383"/>service that allows you to store data in the cloud. The service is based on the IBM Cloud platform.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let's <a id="_idIndexMarker2384"/>explore the <strong class="bold">National Institute of Standards and Technology</strong> (<strong class="bold">NIST</strong>) cloud deployment reference architecture next.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-471"><a id="_idTextAnchor488"/>NIST cloud deployment reference architecture</h2>
			<p>Now <a id="_idIndexMarker2385"/>that we have an understanding of cloud storage, let's look at the NIST cloud deployment reference architecture. The primary actors involved are the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Cloud consumer</strong>: The <a id="_idIndexMarker2386"/>individual or organization that contracts with the cloud service provider to use the cloud services for your organization.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Cloud service provider</strong> (<strong class="bold">CSP</strong>): A cloud provider is a person or organization who <a id="_idIndexMarker2387"/>purchases and manages the computing infrastructure required for offering services directly or via a cloud broker to interested clients via network access.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Cloud service broker</strong>: The integration of cloud services is becoming too difficult <a id="_idIndexMarker2388"/>for cloud consumers to manage and, as a result, they are turning to cloud brokers <a id="_idIndexMarker2389"/>rather than CSPs. The <strong class="bold">cloud broker</strong> is a business that manages cloud services, including use, performance, and delivery, as well as the connection between CSPs and cloud consumers.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Cloud auditor</strong>: An <a id="_idIndexMarker2390"/>organization that is hired by the cloud consumer to assess, test, and report on cloud service providers and brokers, as well as the management and security of the cloud environment.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Cloud carrier</strong>: The <a id="_idIndexMarker2391"/>provider of transport services, such as bandwidth, for cloud-based systems.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let's talk about a Docker next and how it's used in helping to facilitate the NIST architecture.</p>
			<h3>What's a Docker?</h3>
			<p>The acronym <strong class="bold">Docker</strong> stands for <strong class="bold">digital container</strong>. It's a <a id="_idIndexMarker2392"/>software technology that lets containers <a id="_idIndexMarker2393"/>be run on various platforms. To guarantee that apps function properly, all Docker dependencies are in the form of containers. Through OS-level virtualization, Docker provides a PaaS that delivers containerized software applications. This technology isolates apps from the infrastructure to speed up software delivery. The advantage of Docker is that it allows applications to run in any environment since they are packaged with their dependencies into a Docker container.</p>
			<h3>Microservices</h3>
			<p>Microservices are <a id="_idIndexMarker2394"/>a software development technique that allows you to break your application down into smaller, more manageable pieces. Each microservice can be written in a different language and run on its own platform. This makes them easy to scale and manage, and it also gives you the flexibility to choose the best technology for each microservice. Microservices are perfect for cloud deployments because they make it easy to scale your application up or down as needed.</p>
			<h3>Understanding Kubernetes</h3>
			<p>Kubernetes is an <a id="_idIndexMarker2395"/>open source system for managing containers at scale. It was developed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. Kubernetes provides a platform for deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications. It can be used on-premises or in the cloud, and it supports a wide variety of platforms, including Linux, Windows, and macOS.</p>
			<p>Kubernetes is a powerful tool, and if you're using containers in your cloud deployments, you should learn how to use it. It can help you manage your containers more effectively and scale your applications up or down as needed.</p>
			<h3>Container security challenges</h3>
			<p>While containers offer a number of benefits, they also present some security challenges. Because containers <a id="_idIndexMarker2396"/>include all the application's dependencies, they can be a target for hackers. You need to take steps to secure your containers and protect them from attack. </p>
			<p>One way to secure your containers is to use authentication and authorization mechanisms. You can also use firewalls and other security measures to protect your containers from attack. It's also important to keep your container images up to date, so you can stay ahead of the latest security threat.</p>
			<h3>Serverless computing</h3>
			<p>Serverless computing is a new technology that allows you to run applications without having to worry about servers. With serverless computing, the server is abstracted away and all you need to <a id="_idIndexMarker2397"/>worry about is the code. This makes it easy to deploy applications, and it also eliminates the need for server management.</p>
			<p>Serverless applications are not entirely serverless; servers must be present, but they aren't visible to developers. In the service provider's cloud-hosted architecture, the application software executes on a third-party service provider's managed infrastructure. The cloud service provider is in charge of provisioning, scaling, load balancing, and securing the serverless infrastructure. The cloud service provider is also responsible for software and system patch management, as well as the underlying operating systems and applications and services.</p>
			<p>Now that we have discussed how the cloud operates and what it does, let's talk about how we can attack the cloud next.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-472"><a id="_idTextAnchor489"/>Attacking the cloud</h1>
			<p>The cloud <a id="_idIndexMarker2398"/>has its security challenges as we're about to find out. Let's discuss some of the challenges we face when securing the cloud environment.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-473"><a id="_idTextAnchor490"/>Cloud security</h2>
			<p>One of the <a id="_idIndexMarker2399"/>biggest concerns with cloud computing is security. When your data is stored in the cloud, you need to be sure that it is safe and secure. Here's the secret about cloud security: it's just another network infrastructure that we might be including within our own networks. So, the exact same threats that we experience against our internal networks (including wireless) are the same threats we see with the cloud. Things <a id="_idIndexMarker2400"/>such as injection attacks, authentication issues, data leakage, misconfiguration, coding issues, passwords, and web server/app weaknesses are just a few of them. However, I'd be failing you if I didn't at least talk about a couple of them, so here we go:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Make sure you choose a reputable cloud provider with a good reputation for security.</li>
				<li>Use strong passwords and authentication methods.</li>
				<li>Encrypt your data.</li>
				<li>Avoid storing sensitive data in the cloud.</li>
				<li>Be aware of the cloud's vulnerabilities and how to protect against them.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The cloud is a great way to deploy your applications, and it offers several benefits, including flexibility, scalability, and convenience. But it's important to be aware of the security challenges involved in using the cloud and take steps to protect your data. With the right precautions, you can safely deploy your applications in the cloud and enjoy all the benefits it has to offer.</p>
			<p>Let's now talk about some specific ways in which we can attack the cloud.</p>
			<h3>API vulnerabilities</h3>
			<p>If you want to hack cloud infrastructures, a good place to start is with API vulnerabilities. APIs are <a id="_idIndexMarker2401"/>the backbone of many cloud-based services, and they often have more lax security than other parts of the infrastructure. By finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in APIs, attackers can gain access to sensitive data or disrupt service availability.</p>
			<p>API vulnerabilities can be divided into two broad categories: those that allow access to sensitive data and those that allow attackers to cause a denial of service. API vulnerabilities <a id="_idIndexMarker2402"/>that allow access to sensitive data include SQL injection flaws and <strong class="bold">cross-site scripting</strong> (<strong class="bold">XSS</strong>) flaws. API vulnerabilities that allow <a id="_idIndexMarker2403"/>attackers to cause a denial of service include buffer overflow flaws and <strong class="bold">cross-site request forgery</strong> (<strong class="bold">CSRF</strong>) flaws.</p>
			<p>Attackers can use various methods to locate API vulnerabilities, including data mining publicly available information, such as source code repositories and bug trackers. Attackers can also use automated tools to scan for known vulnerabilities in popular APIs.</p>
			<p>Once an attacker has found a vulnerability in an API, they can exploit it in several ways. For example, they may use it to gain access to sensitive data or launch a denial-of-service attack.</p>
			<p>To prevent <a id="_idIndexMarker2404"/>attackers from exploiting API vulnerabilities, organizations should implement a comprehensive security program that includes both the static and dynamic testing of APIs. Static testing can help identify potential vulnerabilities, while dynamic testing can help verify that vulnerabilities have been properly fixed.</p>
			<p>Organizations should also consider implementing rate-limiting and other controls to limit the impact of denial-of-service attacks. Organizations can help protect their cloud-based services from attack by taking these steps.</p>
			<h3>Service hijacking using social engineering</h3>
			<p>Yep, it's a "thing". The bad guys are getting craftier and more devious in their attacks. And <a id="_idIndexMarker2405"/>unfortunately, social engineering is one of their favorite tools. An attacker steals the credentials of a CSP or a customer by phishing, pharming, social engineering, and exploiting software vulnerabilities in order to commit account or service takeover. The attacker obtains access to cloud computing services using the stolen credentials and jeopardizes data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Attackers may attempt to reset passwords or IT personnel to access their cloud services to obtain passwords. Password guessing, keylogging malware, utilizing password-cracking approaches, and sending phishing emails are additional methods for obtaining passwords.</p>
			<h3>Side-channel attacks or cross-guest virtual machine (VM) breaches</h3>
			<p>Malicious <a id="_idIndexMarker2406"/>insiders and attackers can use side-channel <a id="_idIndexMarker2407"/>attacks to steal data or sensitive information from VMs. Cross-guest VM breaches are another way that attackers can do so. By compromising another guest's VM on the same physical server, attackers can steal data or sensitive information from other VMs on the same server.</p>
			<h3>Wrapping attacks</h3>
			<p><em class="italic">"This one's dedicated to all the hackers in the house!" </em></p>
			<p><em class="italic">Even out settle scores quick,</em></p>
			<p><em class="italic">Our disaster recovery requires even more disks,</em></p>
			<p><em class="italic">Put your bytes up, prove it or you forfeit, </em></p>
			<p><em class="italic">Got my C64 and we blew it into orbit</em>" </p>
			<p><em class="italic">– Dual-Core "All The Things"</em> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoUWHfh733Y">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoUWHfh733Y</a>)</p>
			<p>Oh, wrong <a id="_idIndexMarker2408"/>kind of wrap. My bad.</p>
			<p>In a wrapping attack, the adversary deception takes place during the translation of the <strong class="bold">Simple Object Access Protocol</strong> (<strong class="bold">SOAP</strong>) message in TLS. The intruder copies the message's <a id="_idIndexMarker2409"/>body and transmits it to the server as though they were a legitimate user. The server verifies the authentication by comparing the signature value (which is also duplicated) to the original. An attacker can then break into the cloud and execute malicious code to disrupt the cloud servers' normal operation.</p>
			<h3>Man-in-the-Cloud (MITC)</h3>
			<p>An MITC <a id="_idIndexMarker2410"/>attack is an attack in which the attacker controls or alters the cloud application's behavior. Attackers can use MITC attacks to bypass security controls, inject malicious code into applications, and steal data. They can also use MITC attacks to gain access to other users' accounts and conduct other malicious activities. </p>
			<h3>Cloud hopper attack</h3>
			<p>The cloud <a id="_idIndexMarker2411"/>hopper attack is a sophisticated hacking campaign that targets organizations that use cloud-based services. Cloud hopper attacks are triggered at managed service providers (MSPs) and their customers. The goal of the attack is to steal data and intellectual property from these organizations. The cloud hopper attack uses a variety of techniques, including malware, phishing, and social engineering, to gain access to the organization's systems. Once they have access, the attackers steal data and intellectual property and then move on to other organizations.</p>
			<h3>Cloud cryptojacking</h3>
			<p>Cryptojacking is <a id="_idIndexMarker2412"/>the unauthorized use of someone else's computer to mine cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency mining is a process that uses computing power to solve complex <a id="_idIndexMarker2413"/>mathematical problems in order to verify and record transactions on a blockchain. Cryptojacking is becoming a more common attack vector because it is easy to execute and does not require a lot of technical knowledge. Attackers can use cryptojacking to mine cryptocurrency on the victim's computer without their knowledge or consent. They can also use cryptojacking to mine cryptocurrency on the computer of an organization's employees. This can result in financial losses for the organization and decreased productivity for the employees.</p>
			<h3>Cloudborne malware</h3>
			<p>Cloudborne is <a id="_idIndexMarker2414"/>a security vulnerability in a bare-metal cloud server that allows attackers to install <a id="_idIndexMarker2415"/>a malicious backdoor into the firmware. The installed malware can remain even if the server is reassigned to new clients or organizations who utilize it as an IaaS. Physical servers are not confined to one client and can be moved from one client to another. Cloudborne malware is malware that is designed to infect cloud-based systems. Cloudborne malware can be used to steal data, sabotage systems, and spread ransomware. It can also be used to gain access to the organization's systems and steal data. Cloudborne malware is a growing threat because it is difficult to detect and can be used to target a wide range of organizations.</p>
			<h3>Gaining access by exploiting SSRF vulnerabilities</h3>
			<p><strong class="bold">Server-Side Request Forgery</strong> (<strong class="bold">SSRF</strong>) is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to send <a id="_idIndexMarker2416"/>requests from the server to external resources that the server should not be able to access. </p>
			<p>One <a id="_idIndexMarker2417"/>way an attacker can exploit an SSRF vulnerability is by sending a request to a cloud storage service, such as <a id="_idIndexMarker2418"/>Azure Blob storage or Amazon <strong class="bold">Simple Storage Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">S3</strong>), and then reading the response from the service. This can be done by using the <strong class="source-inline">fetch</strong> API in JavaScript, or by using the <strong class="source-inline">get has</strong> command in Linux.</p>
			<p>Once the attacker has access to the response from the cloud storage service, they can then download any files that are stored in the service.</p>
			<p>Another way an attacker can exploit an SSRF vulnerability is by sending a request to a web server that is hosting a sensitive file, such as a configuration file or a database. The attacker <a id="_idIndexMarker2419"/>can then download the contents of the file by using the <strong class="source-inline">GET</strong> command in Linux.</p>
			<p>By exploiting an SSRF vulnerability, an attacker can gain access to sensitive files that are stored in the cloud, and they can also steal data from cloud-based applications.</p>
			<p>Next, let's talk about container vulnerabilities.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-474"><a id="_idTextAnchor491"/>Container vulnerabilities</h2>
			<p>Containers are a popular way to deploy applications in the cloud. They allow applications <a id="_idIndexMarker2420"/>to be isolated from the underlying system and make it easy to move applications from one server to another. However, container vulnerabilities can allow attackers to gain access to the underlying system and steal data or install malware. Attackers can also use containers to hide their malicious activities from the organization's security tools. Containers are a popular target for attackers because they are easy to exploit and provide a lot of access to the underlying system. </p>
			<p>The following are some of the more common vulnerabilities security professionals should be aware of:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Insecure container runtime configurations</strong>: Containers can be insecure if the runtime configurations are not set up properly. Attackers can use these vulnerabilities to gain access to the underlying system and steal data or install malware.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Embedded malware</strong>: Malware can be embedded in the application code that is run on the container. This malware can remain active even after the container is deleted or reassigned to another client.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Poor access control</strong>: Containers typically have poor access control, which allows attackers to gain access to the underlying system and steal data or install malware.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Insufficient security controls</strong>: Containers do not have the same security controls as the underlying system, which allows attackers to bypass security controls and steal data or install malware.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Leaky containers</strong>: Containers can leak data to the underlying system, which can allow attackers to steal data or install malware.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Insecure data storage</strong>: Container data can be insecurely stored on the underlying system, which can allow attackers to steal data or install malware.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Organizations <a id="_idIndexMarker2421"/>should be aware of these vulnerabilities and take steps to mitigate them. Security professionals should also be aware of these vulnerabilities and take steps to protect their organizations from them.</p>
			<p>Let's talk next about some of the specific tools and techniques that attackers use.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-475"><a id="_idTextAnchor492"/>Tools and techniques of the attackers</h1>
			<p>To attack the cloud, a hacker will need tools to do so. Here, we will discuss some of the more common tools that are available.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-476"><a id="_idTextAnchor493"/>The tools </h2>
			<p>A container image is a <a id="_idIndexMarker2422"/>software package that includes an operating system, application, runtime, and other components. These containers are frequently reused throughout the industry and may include open source libraries with security concerns. These flaws endanger not only the security of each container but also that of the entire container engine. Tools such as Clair, Twistlock, and Trivy are great options for attacking containers.</p>
			<p>Looking to find <a id="_idIndexMarker2423"/>attack Kubernetes, also known as K8s? Most of the vulnerabilities we find are <a id="_idIndexMarker2424"/>based on misconfiguration. Sysdig (<a href="http://sysdig.com">sysdig.com</a>) is a <a id="_idIndexMarker2425"/>great tool to not only scan for vulnerabilities but also for validating container images.</p>
			<p>Believe it or not, attackers <a id="_idIndexMarker2426"/>use Google hacking techniques to identify Amazon Cloud storage <a id="_idIndexMarker2427"/>services (called S3 buckets)! If you remember our Google hacks, we can use the <strong class="source-inline">inurl</strong> syntax to look for subdomains that are used by AWS.</p>
			<p>For example:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">inurl: s3.amazonaws.com</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">inurl: s3.amazonaws.com/ audio/</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">inurl: s3.amazonaws.com/video/</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">inurl: s3.amazonaws.com/backup/</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">inurl: s3.amazonaws.com/movie/</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">inurl: s3.amazonaws.com/image/</pre>
			<p>But if you <a id="_idIndexMarker2428"/>want a more straightforward method, you can look at S3Scanner (<a href="https://github.com/sa7mon/S3Scanner">https://github.com/sa7mon/S3Scanner</a>) to identify open S3 buckets of cloud services, such as AWS, and retrieve their content for <em class="italic">evil</em> purposes.</p>
			<p>Let's consider some additional tools and security risks these tools can assist us with next.</p>
			<h3>Enumerating AWS account IDs and roles</h3>
			<p>AWS accounts are identified by unique IDs that, if made public, might be used by attackers <a id="_idIndexMarker2429"/>to target cloud services. These persistent identifiers are intended to be private, yet they are frequently exposed to the general <a id="_idIndexMarker2430"/>public without the user's knowledge. Attackers can take advantage of this information leakage and use it for nefarious purposes. By <a id="_idIndexMarker2431"/>analyzing AWS error messages, attackers can determine what <strong class="bold">Identity and Access Management</strong> (<strong class="bold">IAM</strong>) role names exist. The existence of a user is revealed in AWS Cloud services through the errors, which give information about the presence of a user. Users are usually permitted to take on numerous roles in AWS Cloud services. Every failure on the part of AWS results in information being revealed about the role's existence. If an AWS account is blocked after a certain number of tries, implementing a brute-force approach might be challenging but not impossible.</p>
			<h3>CloudGoat AWS</h3>
			<p>CloudGoat <a id="_idIndexMarker2432"/>is a tool (<a href="http://rhinosecuritylabs.com">rhinosecuritylabs.com</a>) that allows you to test the <a id="_idIndexMarker2433"/>security of your AWS account. The tool is based on the <strong class="bold">Open Web Application Security Project</strong> (<strong class="bold">OWASP</strong>) Top 10 security risks. Yep, OWASP <a id="_idIndexMarker2434"/>has a list for cloud security.</p>
			<p>The following are <a id="_idIndexMarker2435"/>the top 10 security risks CloudGoat tests for:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1"><strong class="bold">Injection</strong>: The injection of unauthorized code into a web application.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Broken authentication and session management</strong>: Unsecured login credentials and session cookies. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Cross-site scripting (XSS)</strong>: Malicious code that is executed when a user visits a web page. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Insecure direct object references</strong>: Unauthorized access to sensitive data.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Security misconfiguration</strong>: Incorrectly configured security settings.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Insufficient authorization and authentication</strong>: Lack of proper authentication checks. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Insufficient cryptography</strong>: Weak cryptography algorithms and keys.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Tampering with data</strong>: Tampering with information to change its integrity.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)</strong>: Attackers trick a user into performing actions that they didn't intend to do.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Information leakage and improper authorization</strong>: Unauthorized access to data.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Other tools that can be used to analyze cloud services/deployments include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>DockerScan</li>
				<li>GCPBucketBrute</li>
				<li>AWS pwn</li>
			</ul>
			<p>And I'm sure there are hundreds more, but these are the ones you'll want to be aware of for your <em class="italic">immediate future</em>.</p>
			<p>Let's consider some best practices for securing the cloud next.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-477"><a id="_idTextAnchor494"/>Best practices for securing the cloud</h1>
			<p>The first thing that you can do to improve the security of your cloud-based systems is to enable SSL (Secure Socket Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) encryption. This will help to <a id="_idIndexMarker2436"/>protect your data from being intercepted by attackers.</p>
			<p>You can also improve the security of your systems by using firewalls and an IDS (intrusion detection system) and an IPS (intrusion prevention system). These devices can help to protect your systems from being attacked by malicious traffic.</p>
			<p>Here's a list of other things you can do:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>To protect your data, you should enforce the use of data encryption and access controls. This includes data that is in rest as well as in motion.</li>
				<li>Disaster recovery planning is another critical factor when securing your cloud-based systems. You should have a plan in place in case of a natural disaster or a security incident.</li>
				<li>Enforce SLAs to ensure your cloud provider meets the security requirements you have outlined.</li>
				<li>Utilize strong AAA (authentication, authorization, and auditing) controls. These controls can help to protect your systems from unauthorized access. </li>
				<li>Stop allowing user credential sharing with your employees. This will help to reduce the risk of a data breach.</li>
				<li>Isolate memory, storage, and network access. This can help to prevent attackers from gaining access to your systems.</li>
				<li>Understand your responsibility model for the cloud. This will help you to determine who is responsible for securing the cloud-based systems.</li>
				<li>Be aware of the risks associated with using cloud services. Educate your employees about these risks and take steps to mitigate them.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To secure your <a id="_idIndexMarker2437"/>cloud-based systems, you need to establish and enforce cloud security policies. These policies should be based on the risk level of the data that is being stored in the cloud.</p>
			<p>Some of the <a id="_idIndexMarker2438"/>things that you should consider when creating your cloud security policies include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The type of data that is being stored in the cloud</li>
				<li>The level of security that is required for the data</li>
				<li>How the data is being accessed and used</li>
				<li>The authentication requirements for accessing the data</li>
				<li>The encryption requirements for the data</li>
				<li>The retention and disposal requirements for the data</li>
				<li>The incident response plan for responding to a data breach</li>
				<li>The disciplinary actions that will be taken against employees who violate the security policies</li>
				<li>The training requirements for employees who are accessing the data</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You should also consider establishing a cloud security governance framework. This will help to ensure that your cloud security policies are being followed.</p>
			<h3>Double-check your compliance requirements</h3>
			<p>When you <a id="_idIndexMarker2439"/>are storing data in the cloud, you need to make sure you are adhering to the relevant compliance requirements. These requirements vary from organization to organization, so you will need to consult with your legal department to make sure you comply.</p>
			<p>Some of the <a id="_idIndexMarker2440"/>standard compliance requirements that apply to cloud-based systems include: </p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act</strong> (<strong class="bold">HIPAA</strong>)</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">The Sarbanes-Oxley Act</strong> (<strong class="bold">SOX</strong>)</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard</strong> (PCI DSS)</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act</strong> (<strong class="bold">GLBA</strong>)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Finally, you <a id="_idIndexMarker2441"/>should make <a id="_idIndexMarker2442"/>sure that you regularly update the software and firmware <a id="_idIndexMarker2443"/>on your devices. This <a id="_idIndexMarker2444"/>will help to protect your systems from being exploited by known vulnerabilities.</p>
			<p>By following these best practices, you can help improve your cloud-based systems' security. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-478"><a id="_idTextAnchor495"/>Summary</h1>
