			<h1 id="_idParaDest-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"/>Preface</h1>
			<p>Congratulations, dear reader! Over the past 15 years or so, there has been tremendous growth in the use of cloud platforms. Amazon’s AWS formally launched in 2006, and Microsoft Azure and <strong class="bold">Google Cloud Platform</strong> (<strong class="bold">GCP</strong>) soon followed in 2008. There are many cloud platforms out there, but AWS, Azure, and GCP are the most popular. AWS, Azure, and GCP empower companies, organizations, and enterprises to deploy networks that are more powerful and scalable than what was possible to do on their own premises. Many organizations even have more than one cloud platform in <span class="No-Break">their networks.</span></p>
			<p>Cloud networks are connected to the public internet, so naturally, they’re susceptible to a wide range of cyberattacks. With the growing popularity of cloud platforms and companies realizing that they need to secure their cloud networks for the sake of business success, people with cloud penetration testing skills are greatly needed in the international job market. By learning how to simulate cyberattacks in cloud platforms for the sake of security testing, your abilities will be desired, no matter where in the world <span class="No-Break">you are.</span></p>
			<p>Pentesting and red teaming in cloud platforms is fundamentally different from doing so in a company’s on-premises networks because Amazon, Microsoft, and Google own the infrastructure. There are rules and policies that you must abide by as a pentester beyond your organization’s own rules and policies. This book will teach you how to perform penetration tests and red team engagements in a <span class="No-Break">cloud-native way.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>This book is for both experienced pentesters and people who are just starting to learn pentesting. If you have experience with traditional pentesting in on-premises networks, this book will teach you how pentesting with AWS, Azure, and GCP is a bit different. If you’re just starting to learn pentesting in general, this book is a great starting point because the cloud is the future of pentesting. Either way, you should be comfortable with computer networking and eager to refine <span class="No-Break">your skills.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>What this book covers</h1>
			<p><a href="B18672_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">How Do Enterprises Utilize and Implement Cloud Networks?</em>, introduces AWS, Azure, and GCP, the difference between hybrid cloud, all-cloud, and multi-cloud networks, software-as-a-service, platform-as-a-service, and infrastructure-as-a-service, and the shared cybersecurity responsibilities between organizations and their cloud providers. Before you start pentesting in AWS, Azure, and GCP, it’s important to understand why and how enterprises use those <span class="No-Break">cloud platforms.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B18672_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor030"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">How Are Cloud Networks Cyber Attacked?</em>, examines how cloud networks are susceptible to a wide range of cyberattacks. This chapter explains the various types of cyber attacks, both external and internal, and attacks that impact the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of computer data, based on the CIA Triad cybersecurity model. You will test the security of cloud networks, based on simulating some of the actions of cyber <span class="No-Break">threat actors.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B18672_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor050"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Key Concepts for Pentesting Today’s Cloud Networks</em>, covers the core concepts and procedures that are applicable to all cloud pentests. Before a pentest or red team engagement is conducted, security professionals must understand the state and scope of their pentest target. You should conduct a vulnerability assessment to find exposed services and integrations, and once a pentest is done, you need to share your findings effectively so that your client’s security posture can be <span class="No-Break">improved accordingly.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B18672_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor067"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Security Features in AWS</em>, explores the plethora of features, applications, and tools that are specific to AWS and their implications for pentesters. This chapter also covers AWS’s own security policies and <span class="No-Break">security tools.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B18672_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor080"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Pentesting AWS Features through Serverless Applications and Tools</em>, discusses the most relevant and effective security features and tools to conduct the most successful AWS pentest possible. There are a number of security controls, security features, and pentesting tools that are specific to AWS, both first-party <span class="No-Break">and third-party.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B18672_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor101"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Pentesting Containerized Applications in AWS</em>, dives into the specific technicalities of how Docker and Kubernetes are deployed and managed in AWS. Enterprises are increasingly deploying containerized applications within AWS to fully leverage the scalability of containerization for virtualization. You will then learn pentesting techniques that are unique to how those containerization platforms run <span class="No-Break">in AWS.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B18672_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor115"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Security Features in Azure</em>, explores the plethora of features, applications, and tools that are specific to Azure and their implications for pentesters. The chapter also covers Azure’s own security policies and <span class="No-Break">security tools.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B18672_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor141"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Pentesting Azure Features through Serverless Applications and Tools</em>, examines the most relevant and effective security features and tools to conduct the most successful Azure pentest possible. There are a number of security controls, security features, and pentesting tools that are specific to Azure, both first-party <span class="No-Break">and third-party.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B18672_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor159"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Pentesting Containerized Applications in Azure</em>, covers the specific technicalities of how Docker and Kubernetes are deployed and managed in Azure.

			<p>Pentesters and red teams test the security of computer systems. In this book, the types of computer systems you will learn how to pentest are cloud applications and networks. Before you start testing something, you should understand what it is that you’re testing in the first place! So, in this part, we will learn all about the different types of cloud services and applications, why organizations use them, and how they’re configured and deployed. We will also learn about the basics of pentesting and red teams. This knowledge will set a foundation for everything else that you’ll learn in <span class="No-Break">this book.</span></p>
