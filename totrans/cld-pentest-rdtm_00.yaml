- en: Congratulations, dear reader! Over the past 15 years or so, there has been tremendous
    growth in the use of cloud platforms. Amazon’s AWS formally launched in 2006,
    and Microsoft Azure and **Google Cloud Platform** (**GCP**) soon followed in 2008\.
    There are many cloud platforms out there, but AWS, Azure, and GCP are the most
    popular. AWS, Azure, and GCP empower companies, organizations, and enterprises
    to deploy networks that are more powerful and scalable than what was possible
    to do on their own premises. Many organizations even have more than one cloud
    platform in their networks.

    to a wide range of cyberattacks. With the growing popularity of cloud platforms
    and companies realizing that they need to secure their cloud networks for the
    sake of business success, people with cloud penetration testing skills are greatly
    needed in the international job market. By learning how to simulate cyberattacks
    in cloud platforms for the sake of security testing, your abilities will be desired,
    no matter where in the world you are.

- en: Pentesting and red teaming in cloud platforms is fundamentally different from
    doing so in a company’s on-premises networks because Amazon, Microsoft, and Google
    own the infrastructure. There are rules and policies that you must abide by as
    a pentester beyond your organization’s own rules and policies. This book will
    teach you how to perform penetration tests and red team engagements in a cloud-native
    way.

- en: This book is for both experienced pentesters and people who are just starting
    to learn pentesting. If you have experience with traditional pentesting in on-premises
    networks, this book will teach you how pentesting with AWS, Azure, and GCP is
    a bit different. If you’re just starting to learn pentesting in general, this
    book is a great starting point because the cloud is the future of pentesting.
    Either way, you should be comfortable with computer networking and eager to refine
    your skills.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 1*](B18672_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014), *How Do Enterprises Utilize
    and Implement Cloud Networks?*, introduces AWS, Azure, and GCP, the difference
    between hybrid cloud, all-cloud, and multi-cloud networks, software-as-a-service,
    platform-as-a-service, and infrastructure-as-a-service, and the shared cybersecurity
    responsibilities between organizations and their cloud providers. Before you start
    pentesting in AWS, Azure, and GCP, it’s important to understand why and how enterprises
    use those cloud platforms.'

    Attacked?*, examines how cloud networks are susceptible to a wide range of cyberattacks.
    This chapter explains the various types of cyber attacks, both external and internal,
    and attacks that impact the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of computer
    data, based on the CIA Triad cybersecurity model. You will test the security of
    cloud networks, based on simulating some of the actions of cyber threat actors.'

    Today’s Cloud Networks*, covers the core concepts and procedures that are applicable
    to all cloud pentests. Before a pentest or red team engagement is conducted, security
    professionals must understand the state and scope of their pentest target. You
    should conduct a vulnerability assessment to find exposed services and integrations,
    and once a pentest is done, you need to share your findings effectively so that
    your client’s security posture can be improved accordingly.'

    and responsibilities, and write a pentest report that will help the business leaders

    the types of computer systems you will learn how to pentest are cloud applications
    and networks. Before you start testing something, you should understand what it
    is that you’re testing in the first place! So, in this part, we will learn all
    about the different types of cloud services and applications, why organizations
    use them, and how they’re configured and deployed. We will also learn about the
    basics of pentesting and red teams. This knowledge will set a foundation for everything
    else that you’ll learn in this book.
