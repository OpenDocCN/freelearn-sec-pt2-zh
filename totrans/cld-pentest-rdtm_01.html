			<h1 id="_idParaDest-16"><a id="_idTextAnchor015"/>How Do Enterprises Utilize and Implement Cloud Networks?</h1>
			<p>Welcome, readers! Whether you’re already an experienced penetration tester or you’re new to cybersecurity, penetration testing cloud networks requires specialized knowledge. One of the key differences between penetration testing cloud networks and penetration testing on-premises networks and computer systems is that the organization you’re working for doesn’t own everything in its computing environment. When you conduct red team engagements<a id="_idIndexMarker000"/> in cloud networks, both the organization you work for and its cloud provider (whether that's <strong class="bold">Amazon Web Services</strong> (<strong class="bold">AWS</strong>), Azure, or <strong class="bold">Google Cloud Platform</strong> (<strong class="bold">GCP</strong>)) have needs that must be respected. The good news is if you master the skill of pentesting cloud networks, you may have<a id="_idIndexMarker001"/> a lucrative career ahead of you. Organizations use the cloud now more than ever, and demand for cloud services continues <span class="No-Break">to grow.</span></p>
			<p>Penetration testers simulate cyber attacks within a network with permission of its owner, in order to find security vulnerabilities that an attacker can discover. The company that hires you to <strong class="bold">penetration test</strong> (<strong class="bold">pentest</strong>) will have likely already performed vulnerability assessments and audits on their network. A lot of security vulnerabilities can be found through assessments and auditing. Pentesting is a hands-on review for finding additional security vulnerabilities that may have <span class="No-Break">been missed.</span></p>
			<p>A red team is a group within an organization that performs targeted pentests on a regular basis. Your company’s cybersecurity team may become aware of new cyber threats and <strong class="bold">advanced persistent threats</strong> (<strong class="bold">APTs</strong>) from the <strong class="bold">security operations center</strong> (<strong class="bold">SOC</strong>) or the broader cybersecurity community. The red team will be informed of particular emerging threats and be asked to simulate them. By doing that, the red team will discover vulnerabilities that the emerging attackers may exploit. Those discoveries are shared with the defensive security team, who will security harden their network accordingly before the threat strikes their organization. For instance, a new ransomware group may make news headlines. It’s the red team’s job to research how the new ransomware group operates. Then, the next step is for them to pretend to be that new ransomware group in their next red team engagement. The red team, the offensive security specialists, will probably be kept pretty busy year-round, because lots of new cyber attack groups and cyber threats emerge every year, every month, every week, and <span class="No-Break">every day!</span></p>

			</ul>
			<p>Let’s <span class="No-Break">get started!</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-17"><a id="_idTextAnchor016"/>Cloud networks today</h1>
			<p>To be able to effectively test<a id="_idIndexMarker002"/> your pentest target, you must first understand it. Cloud networks have been popular with the enterprise market ever since AWS took its current form in 2006. Microsoft Azure and GCP have been around since 2008. These three cloud platforms are the most frequently used by businesses and enterprises of all kinds, all around the world. Most enterprises use at least one cloud platform in their networks these days. Some enterprises even use multiple cloud platforms. So, what are cloud platforms, and why are they so popular? How do cloud platforms improve how companies do business over <span class="No-Break">the internet?</span></p>
			<p>In the 1990s, enterprises had to host their own data centers on their premises. Web hosting providers started to operate that decade, but they only offered web servers and email servers. That’s good for an organization’s website and email, but not for anything else. If companies needed to run their own, more complex applications and digital services, they needed to have their own server rooms <span class="No-Break">and equipment.</span></p>
			<p>Any network administrator with years of experience understands that enterprises can have rapidly changing computer networking needs. Bandwidth and data storage usage may double in a couple of months, and then halve in another couple of months. If their capacity needs quickly grow in a short period of time, lots of new server machines and networking infrastructure would have to be procured, and they would need a lot more physical space for them to occupy. If their capacity needs shrank quite a bit, a lot of expensive server machines, networking infrastructure, and physical space would have to go to waste. There are a lot of inconveniences, inefficiencies, and financial waste that are inevitable when a company deploys a large <span class="No-Break">network on-premises.</span></p>
			<p>The 21st century<a id="_idIndexMarker003"/> so far has brought useful advancements in computer networking technology. Tech giants such as <strong class="bold">Amazon</strong>, <strong class="bold">Microsoft</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Google</strong> have massive data centers all around the world. They began to utilize their massive computer networking infrastructure by offering it to third-party businesses and other entities. AWS launched in 2006, then Microsoft Azure and GCP followed in 2008. They made it easier and more frictionless than ever for businesses to deploy networks on <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">their</em></span><span class="No-Break"> infrastructure.</span></p>
			<p>Containerization is a way to implement operating system and hardware virtualization with load balancing to deploy applications through networks in a scalable and dynamic way that uses server machines more efficiently. When an operating system is virtualized, it runs like an application within another operating system with simulated hardware specifications. Load balancing distributes network traffic across multiple server machines, and it prevents server overload by improving application availability and responsiveness. Each container has operating system components and is part of an application. Containers run within a containerization orchestration platform and a host operating system or direct hypervisor. Because containers are self-sufficient virtualized entities, an application might use a large number of them at any given time, and any individual container might only live for a few days. Containers can be quickly launched and terminated according to what a cloud application needs as it <span class="No-Break">operates continuously.</span></p>
			<p>Docker emerged in 2013, and Kubernetes started to become popular in 2015. There are other containerization orchestration platforms, but Docker and Kubernetes are the ones you’ll see in cloud networks the most often. Those are the containerization orchestration platforms that are best supported by AWS, Azure, and GCP. As containerization became more common, it helped to encourage more enterprises to implement cloud platforms into <span class="No-Break">their networks.</span></p>
			<p>The DevOps approach has transformed the manner in which organizations roll out their applications. It’s a predominant method for developing applications intended for cloud deployments. By merging the development and operations (IT) teams, DevOps fosters continuous collaboration. The teams patch applications and deploy new features in small pieces, and very frequently. Instead of releasing version 1.5 of an application one year and version 1.6 the next, applications can be updated several times per month. DevOps complements agile application development, so applications are deployed more efficiently and responsively. It’s possible to use the DevOps methodology without the cloud, but the cloud makes it much more feasible. You will likely be pentesting DevOps applications at least at some point as a cloud pentester. And because of how frequently DevOps applications change, that’ll keep you very busy. DevSecOps is when security is implemented into DevOps, and you’ll quite possibly be a part of the Sec component of <span class="No-Break">the process.</span></p>
			<p>Ever since AWS, Azure, and GCP<a id="_idIndexMarker004"/> launched, they’ve constantly added new services and new features. If each cloud platform’s service list were a restaurant menu, it’d have a handful of dishes in 2009 and multiple pages of <em class="italic">entrées</em> by 2023. All of these new services and features have empowered organizations to do a greater variety of things with <span class="No-Break">cloud platforms.</span></p>
			<p>Amazon, Microsoft, and Google<a id="_idIndexMarker005"/> are responsible for maintaining their infrastructure and <strong class="bold">application programming interfaces</strong> (<strong class="bold">APIs</strong>) for their services. They’re responsible for running their data centers and managing the massive facilities all around the world in which they operate. That’s a lot of burden that enterprises no longer have to deal with when they use a <span class="No-Break">cloud platform.</span></p>
			<p>If an organization needs to double its data storage capacity and network bandwidth all of a sudden, all it has to do is ask Amazon, Microsoft, or Google, pay their fees, and it’ll have it almost immediately. If an organization’s networking needs are reduced, decreasing its data storage and bandwidth is just as easy. That’s what we call scalability. Cloud services dynamically and responsively scale according to an organization’s computing needs at any <span class="No-Break">given time.</span></p>
			<p>Combine AWS, Azure, and GCP’s massive infrastructure with containerization, and cloud networks can grow and evolve very quickly without an enterprise having to deal with the hassles of running their own data centers. Applications can grow, shrink, and rapidly change. The organization deploying an application has full control, while the cloud platform provider deals with all of the <span class="No-Break">physical tedium.</span></p>
			<p>Services such as Netflix, Steam, and Dropbox are responsive and powerful today because they leverage the potential of the cloud. And of course, lots of much smaller organizations in a wide variety of industries also use cloud platforms. The same AWS data center could have a famous video streaming service and a tax and accounting small business operating in the same facility, perhaps even on some of the same physical <span class="No-Break">server machines.</span></p>
			<p>So, that’s why cloud platforms<a id="_idIndexMarker006"/> are so popular these days. Businesses are now deeply committed to using cloud platforms, so you’ll be expected to understand them very well as a pentester on a red team. Cloud platforms are an essential business tool in the 21st century. Unfortunately, because cloud platforms operate through the internet, they’re subject to a wide variety of terrible cyber threats. Organizations need your talent and skill to think like a cyber attacker. Find the vulnerabilities an attacker will exploit so that your blue team (defensive security specialists) can security harden your cloud <span class="No-Break">networks effectively.</span></p>
			<p>As a red teamer, cyber threats<a id="_idIndexMarker007"/> will always keep you on your toes. You’ll always be busy. Heed the words of famous computer scientist and cybersecurity expert <span class="No-Break">Bruce Schneier:</span></p>
			<p class="author-quote">“Security is a process, not a product. Products provide some protection, but the only way to effectively do business in an insecure world is to put processes in place that recognize the inherent insecurity in the products.”</p>
			<p>In the next section, we’ll examine the different kinds of cloud networks. How you pentest your organization’s cloud network will vary according to what sort of cloud network <span class="No-Break">it is.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-18"><a id="_idTextAnchor017"/>Hybrid cloud, all-cloud, and multi-cloud networks</h1>
			<p>Cloud networks can take a few different forms. Some organizations maintain their client machines (such as PCs and mobile devices) on their own premises and then run their backend servers completely on one particular cloud platform. It’s an all-cloud network on one platform such as AWS, Azure, <span class="No-Break">or GCP.</span></p>
			<p>Some organizations run some server machines on their own premises and run the rest of their network on one or multiple cloud platforms. That’s a hybrid cloud network—partly on-premises, partly in <span class="No-Break">the cloud.</span></p>
			<p>Some organizations deploy their networks through more than one cloud platform. They may have some parts of their network running on AWS and other parts on Azure, for example. That’s a <span class="No-Break">multi-cloud network.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s examine how these different ways to operate cloud networks work, and why organizations may choose one way <span class="No-Break">over another.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-19"><a id="_idTextAnchor018"/>All-cloud networks</h2>
			<p>An all-cloud network<a id="_idIndexMarker008"/> is when an enterprise only has client devices on its premises, and the rest of its network is all on cloud services. Call it entirely cloud, cloud-first, cloud-only, or something else. Whether termed as fully cloud-based, cloud-first, cloud-only, or any other name, this shift away from on-premises backend systems is an emerging industry trend. For the sake of clarity, the backend functions of a network are everything that has to run as a server. That includes databases, web servers, email servers, authentication system servers, and any computer networking function that would typically run in a data center rather than inside someone’s office. Those sorts of needs can theoretically all be run from cloud services, whereas people’s phones, tablets, and PCs (client devices) serve as frontend devices when they’re connected to the network. If I had to physically enter a data center in order to check my email on my phone, I’d find that to be <span class="No-Break">very inconvenient!</span></p>
			<p>Research firm Gartner refers to a cloud-first strategy where enterprises prioritize using cloud platforms. A cloud-first strategy doesn’t necessarily mean that an enterprise has an all-cloud network. An enterprise with a cloud-first strategy may have a lot of legacy technology, or services that otherwise predate the popularization of cloud services from the mid-2000s onward. However, any new function or service is deployed on the cloud, and older services and applications are migrated to the cloud as much <span class="No-Break">as possible.</span></p>
			<p>In November 2021, Gartner said that 85% of organizations will embrace a cloud-first principle by 2025. It also believes that 95% of new digital workloads will be deployed on cloud-native platforms (<a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-11-10-gartner-says-cloud-will-be-the-centerpiece-of-new-digital-experiences">https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-11-10-gartner-says-cloud-will-be-the-centerpiece-of-new-digital-experiences</a>). So, if you’re learning to pentest cloud networks, you’re getting into a lucrative line <span class="No-Break">of work!</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-20"><a id="_idTextAnchor019"/>Hybrid cloud networks</h2>
			<p>A hybrid cloud network<a id="_idIndexMarker009"/> is partly on the cloud and partly on-premises. At least some actual backend server operations must be on the enterprise’s premises and connected to a cloud network in order for it to be a hybrid cloud network. If an organization has an on-premises network and a cloud network that aren’t connected in any way, the organization has two separate networks, not one <span class="No-Break">hybrid network.</span></p>
			<p>Why would an organization choose to have a hybrid cloud network? There can be <span class="No-Break">multiple reasons.</span></p>
			<p>They may have a legacy on-premises network, but they’ve needed to integrate some SaaS or PaaS components that are exclusive to AWS, Azure, or GCP. Maybe they need GCP for Looker business data analytics, Azure for Azure DevOps to support Microsoft ecosystem APIs, or AWS for AWS Lambda hassle-free code execution. All three cloud platforms have services that are unique to their ecosystems, and they may serve a specific <span class="No-Break">business need.</span></p>
			<p>Some other organizations believe that maintaining a hybrid cloud network is effective redundancy. Uptime is the most important metric when it comes to operating any sort of network. Redundancy is an effective way to reduce operational downtime. For instance, if a server has a technical problem that puts it out of service, an identical server elsewhere can ensure that its functions keep running. An enterprise may find that having some network infrastructure that it physically controls is good for redundancy. Of course, it cannot physically control cloud servers; it can only physically control the servers that are on its premises. The same applies to networking infrastructure. Cloud providers give organizations a lot of control over the parts of their networks that run on cloud infrastructure, but they cannot allow an organization’s network administrators to walk into one of their cloud data centers and physically turn a server machine off and on again. Other reasons<a id="_idIndexMarker010"/> why an organization may prefer to maintain a hybrid network are <strong class="bold">disaster recovery</strong> (<strong class="bold">DR</strong>) or regulatory compliance. There may be details in its DR procedures or in the regulations it needs to comply with that require it to have physical access to some of <span class="No-Break">its network.</span></p>
			<p>Some organizations may have <strong class="bold">service-level agreements</strong> (<strong class="bold">SLAs</strong>) with vendors that predate their usage of cloud <a id="_idIndexMarker011"/>services. An SLA is a legal agreement between a vendor and a client that outlines the services the client expects to receive, the services the vendor agrees to deliver, and the metrics they’ll use to measure performance. A vendor can be anything from a cloud platform (such as AWS) or any other sort of IT service (such as Slack or Cloudflare). Old SLAs can sometimes make cloud migration tricky. So, some enterprises may wait until their older contracts expire before going all-cloud. In the meantime, they may find a compromise where they maintain their on-premises infrastructure for a period of time while they implement cloud services into <span class="No-Break">their network.</span></p>
			<p>If an organization has a hybrid<a id="_idIndexMarker012"/> cloud, it’ll likely keep its more sensitive or critical data operations on-premises. Sensitive data and systems can include things such as <strong class="bold">public key infrastructure</strong> (<strong class="bold">PKI</strong>), critical databases, and highly sensitive financial or medical data that organizations must keep on their premises<a id="_idIndexMarker013"/> in order to be <span class="No-Break">regulatory compliant.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-21"><a id="_idTextAnchor020"/>Multi-cloud networks</h2>
			<p>In a multi-cloud network, more than one cloud provider<a id="_idIndexMarker014"/> is implemented into an enterprise’s network. For example, it could have AWS and GCP, or a combination of AWS and Azure, or AWS, Azure, and GCP combined. A multi-cloud network may also be a hybrid cloud network if the enterprise also has an on-premises component. Either way, the parts of their network on different cloud platforms have to be connected in some way. Otherwise, they have multiple networks. When you conduct red team engagements for your organization, the reasons for their cloud strategy matter. It’ll help you understand how it uses its cloud network, which will help you understand how cyber threats may impact the organization. Those are the sort of cyber threats you should be simulating in your pentesting. So, let’s examine why many organizations choose to have <span class="No-Break">multi-cloud networks.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-22"><a id="_idTextAnchor021"/>Why an organization would have a multi-cloud network</h1>
			<p>As I’ve mentioned, AWS, Azure, and GCP<a id="_idIndexMarker015"/> each have some services that <a id="_idIndexMarker016"/>are unique to each of them. A business may find that the combination of PaaS and SaaS applications that best serve its operational needs are all on different cloud platforms. An enterprise could have Azure OpenAI Service for automated customer service, Amazon GameLift to host its online video game servers, and a payment gateway on GCP to process customer credit <span class="No-Break">card transactions.</span></p>
			<p>Michael Warrilow, VP Analyst at Gartner, <span class="No-Break">says this:</span></p>
			<p class="author-quote">“Most organizations adopt a multi-cloud strategy out of a desire to avoid vendor lock-in or to take advantage of best-of-breed solutions. We expect that most large organizations will continue to willfully pursue this approach.”</p>
			<p>According to a survey Gartner conducted in 2019, 81% of their respondents are working with two or more providers. That was at least a few years ago. Gartner foretasted an increase in worldwide end-user spending on public cloud services to grow from $490.3 billion in 2022 to $591.8 billion in 2023. Maybe multi-cloud networks are an even larger market segment now. This is important to acknowledge because you may be pentesting some of <span class="No-Break">these services.</span></p>
			<p>You should also understand the difference between public clouds and <span class="No-Break">private clouds.</span></p>
			<p>Up until this point, all of my mentions of the cloud have referred to public clouds. Using AWS, Azure, and GCP usually refers to public cloud usage. A public cloud is a cloud network that shares physical servers and other infrastructure with other users, customers, <span class="No-Break">and clientele.</span></p>
			<p>A lot of consumer<a id="_idIndexMarker017"/> internet services are driven by public clouds. Listening<a id="_idIndexMarker018"/> to Spotify, watching YouTube, uploading personal files to Dropbox, conducting meetings over Zoom, buying games from Steam, and engaging in multiplayer gameplay—these are all common ways that consumers use public cloud-driven applications. And they might not even know it! Businesses often use public cloud services in similar ways—collaborating on documents with Google Docs, conversations over Slack, and meetings through <span class="No-Break">Microsoft Teams.</span></p>
			<p>The majority of business usage of AWS, Azure, and GCP is also public cloud. Private cloud services on third-party infrastructure (AWS, Azure, GCP) are often more expensive. If a company signs up for services such as AWS CodeArtifact for package management, or Computer Vision on Azure for image and video analysis, those are public cloud services. Any service with a free trial period is probably a public <span class="No-Break">cloud service.</span></p>
			<p>Private cloud services can take two forms. They can be on a company’s own premises. Some enterprises have replicated the cloud computing model on their own infrastructure. Alternatively, AWS, Azure, and GCP do offer<a id="_idIndexMarker019"/> some private cloud services. For example, AWS offers <strong class="bold">Amazon Virtual Private Cloud</strong> (<span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Amazon VPC</strong></span><span class="No-Break">).</span></p>
			<p>There are advantages and use cases for both public cloud and private <span class="No-Break">cloud services.</span></p>
			<p>Public cloud services are often a great choice for enterprises because they don’t require capital expenditures; their accountants can budget it as an operational expenditure. From the business end, they’re not paying for products; they’re paying for services. There can be taxation and legal benefits to making a service an operational expenditure rather than a capital expenditure. Public cloud services are usually more scalable because there are no dedicated physical or virtual server machines involved. Enterprises can efficiently use as much or as little space as they need at any given time as long as they’re willing to pay the service fees. Public cloud services also involve less overhead for a business because a third party is responsible for maintaining <span class="No-Break">the infrastructure.</span></p>
			<p>One of the main reasons why an organization may require private cloud services is cybersecurity. As with having any other sort of on-premises component in other types of hybrid cloud networks, regulatory compliance may mandate private instead of public cloud usage. Because an enterprise has exclusive use of a private cloud, it can maintain more control and implement stricter security measures. The regulations it may need to comply with are even more likely to apply to sensitive financial or medical data. For instance, using a private<a id="_idIndexMarker020"/> cloud rather than a public cloud may be necessary for the <strong class="bold">Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act</strong> (<strong class="bold">HIPAA</strong>) (a set of medical data regulations in the United States), or Sarbanes–Oxley (a set of financial data regulations in the United States) compliance in some situations. Also, as with non-cloud on-premises network usage, an organization may choose to deploy the cloud computing model on its own infrastructure for its <span class="No-Break">DR needs.</span></p>
			<p>A hybrid cloud network may have a non-cloud on-premises component, a cloud on-premises component, or a private cloud on a third-party infrastructure component. If a private cloud is on third-party infrastructure through AWS, Azure, or GCP, it’ll need to connect to the client machines<a id="_idIndexMarker021"/> on an enterprise’s premises through private networking—often through some sort of <strong class="bold">virtual private </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">network</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> (</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">VPN</strong></span><span class="No-Break">).</span></p>
			<p>The organization<a id="_idIndexMarker022"/> you work for may be in the cloud migration<a id="_idIndexMarker023"/> process. How your organization migrates to the cloud will impact its security posture! So, we need to better understand cloud migration and how complex it <span class="No-Break">can be.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-23"><a id="_idTextAnchor022"/>The cloud migration process</h1>
			<p>Cloud migration<a id="_idIndexMarker024"/> is when an organization moves its data and services from its on-premises infrastructure to a cloud provider. With the rapid growth of the cloud market over the past 15 or 20 years, a large number of enterprises have engaged in the cloud migration process. But cloud migration isn’t simple, and it can be done incorrectly <span class="No-Break">or ineffectively.</span></p>
			<p>All enterprises must plan carefully in order to migrate to the cloud effectively. Depending on the situation and their needs, they may prefer to migrate to the cloud in stages over the course of months or years rather than do it all <span class="No-Break">at once.</span></p>
			<p>When planning a cloud migration strategy, organizations should understand the problems that can occur with cloud migration so that they can <span class="No-Break">be avoided.</span></p>
			<p>An enterprise’s services may experience downtime during the cloud migration process. Depending on how it migrates to the cloud, some of its servers may have to go completely offline for a period of time. The enterprise’s customers may be very unhappy if the services they receive are interrupted, especially if they spend a lot of money on them. In the cloud migration process, an enterprise’s supply chain must be considered as well as its customer base. An enterprise may have to either plan and prepare for the consequences of downtime, or carefully fine-tune its cloud migration strategy so that there’s no downtime <span class="No-Break">at all.</span></p>
			<p>Interoperability may be a problem. The enterprise’s applications run on its own infrastructure and may not be fully compatible with its cloud service without some tweaks or adjustments. Interoperability is less likely to be a problem if the cloud service it’s migrating to is IaaS. But some applications require implementation with PaaS or SaaS. Interoperability issues must be carefully accounted for when designing a cloud <span class="No-Break">migration strategy.</span></p>
			<p>Crucial data could be lost in the cloud migration process. It could become subject to a data breach or become unavailable. Privileged access management and encryption are security measures that can be used in the cloud migration process to avoid that problem. It’s also important to completely inventory data, applications, and workloads that are being migrated to the cloud. You can’t secure what you <span class="No-Break">can’t see!</span></p>
			<p>Employees who are used to managing data and workloads on-premises may not be familiar with how the details of their tasks may change once they are migrated to the cloud. An enterprise may need to assign new roles in the organization according to the specifics of its cloud infrastructure and implementation. Employees also need training on all of the applicable new technologies they’ll be working with during and after <span class="No-Break">cloud migration.</span></p>
			<p>So, those are some of the more common problems that can occur during the cloud migration process. Those problems are avoidable with careful preparation and planning. Enterprises migrate to the cloud for many good reasons. Let’s <span class="No-Break">examine why.</span></p>
			<p>Cloud networks offer enterprises operational agility. They make it more feasible for employees to work from home and work while they’re traveling. The COVID pandemic has sparked ongoing effects. Scientific research from various entities around the world has shown that many millions of people have left the workforce worldwide due to early death and long-term disability from long COVID. Employees have found better safety and productivity by working from home instead of having to work on-site. Smart employers want to keep their workers healthy and productive and understand the benefits of protecting them from airborne disease. Facilitating working from home with cloud migration is an <span class="No-Break">effective strategy.</span></p>
			<p>The major cloud platforms have security controls that, if used properly, can make remote access to corporate networks more secure from cyber attacks. Cloud adoption and supporting remote work is the 21<span class="superscript">st</span>-century way of doing business, and companies that don’t understand that are losing <span class="No-Break">crucial talent.</span></p>
			<p>Cloud migration<a id="_idIndexMarker025"/> can help reduce capital expenditures and related burdens. Companies don’t have to pay for additional real estate to provide spaces to run their own massive data centers. Amazon, Google, and Microsoft have many of the largest data centers on Earth, on all populated continents. From India to Japan, from the United States to Indonesia, from France to South Africa, many people and employers work within 1,000 kilometers of an AWS, GCP, or Azure data center. But even employers who are 5,000 kilometers from their nearest cloud platform data center still enjoy fast data transfer and minimal latency. Plus, all three cloud providers add new data centers to more parts of the globe each and every year. For many companies, replacing their own on-premises data centers with the flexibility and agility of operating in the cloud is an obvious choice. The reduction in capital expenditures also measurably improves their <span class="No-Break">bottom line.</span></p>
			<p>Even though some companies want to keep some of their network on their premises to facilitate DR (because they’ll have physical access to some of their infrastructure), other companies cite DR as a reason to migrate to the cloud. This shows how complex and nuanced many of these practicalities of operating enterprise networks can be in the real world. AWS, Azure, and GCP all have DR tools and advise companies on how to use them effectively. The massive capacity of their data centers makes it easier and more affordable for companies to maintain backups of petabytes’ and exabytes’ worth of data. The cloud platforms also offer useful tools for organizations to periodically test the viability of their backups, and also to store different types of snapshots. If an organization keeps none of its backend on its premises, its data can be kept safer if its premises are hit by a flood, fire, or earthquake. Amazon, Google, and Microsoft also build redundancy and resiliency into their own networks. They have systems in place for operation if a disaster strikes one of their international data centers. Plus, their physical security is hardened beyond what most organizations can afford to do themselves for their <span class="No-Break">own premises.</span></p>
			<p>So, let’s look at the cloud migration<a id="_idIndexMarker026"/> process. It’s a little bit different for each organization that does it because the nature of their data assets and business operations is unique. But here’s where there’s usually <span class="No-Break">some commonality.</span></p>
			<p>IBM recommends the following steps for every organization’s cloud <span class="No-Break">migration checklist:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>First, organizations should inventory their workloads. A workload is any database, application, containerization system, or service that operates in their network. Determine each workload’s size, complexity, and whether or not it’s <span class="No-Break">in production.</span></li>
				<li>Research each cloud platform and its applications and services carefully. AWS, Azure, and GCP each offer hundreds of unique services. An organization may need different services on different platforms. The most suitable service should be selected for each workload, and that may result in a need for a <span class="No-Break">multi-cloud network.</span></li>
				<li>With services and cloud providers selected, the next step is to conduct a <span class="No-Break">cost assessment.</span></li>
				<li>Next, a team should be assigned to execute the migration. There should be people with advanced computer networking and network security skills on that team. The goals of migration should be communicated to <span class="No-Break">the team.</span></li>
				<li>Determine how much of the migration will be handled internally, and how much by the cloud provider. All three major cloud providers offer cloud migration services, and organizations should verify what <span class="No-Break">they entail.</span></li>
				<li>Prioritize which workloads should be migrated first. There will likely be a period when workloads are mirrored on the on-premises network so that the migration process incurs minimal <span class="No-Break">network downtime.</span></li>
				<li>A plan should be prepared that schedules the migration process and outlines the roadmap. The full migration process could take months or a couple of years according to each company’s specific needs <span class="No-Break">and realities.</span></li>
				<li>Determine whether there are already cloud services in the enterprise network, and whether or not they should be substituted with other cloud services or augmented into larger cloud workloads. For instance, why should a company keep using Dropbox when their Azure services include Microsoft Teams support or their GCP services include Google <span class="No-Break">Drive integration?</span></li>
				<li>Company stakeholders should be informed of what to expect during and after the cloud migration process. The company’s entire supply chain should be included if this impacts them in <span class="No-Break">any way!</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Key performance indicators</strong> (<strong class="bold">KPIs</strong>) should be established for the cloud<a id="_idIndexMarker027"/> migration process—for example, “<em class="italic">50% of our database traffic should occur in our Amazon </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">EC2 instances.</em></span><span class="No-Break">”</span></li>
				<li>Progress should be verified and accessed with the cloud migration team periodically. Finally, during and after the process—test, review, and make adjustments <span class="No-Break">when needed.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>As a cloud pentester, the few months after the cloud migration process<a id="_idIndexMarker028"/> has finished would be an excellent time for a pentest. The common wisdom in our industry is that pentests should be conducted when major changes are made to networks, as change can create new security vulnerabilities. That’s not the only time that pentests and red team engagements should be conducted, but it’s certainly a time when conducting a pentest <span class="No-Break">is crucial.</span></p>
			<p>Understanding security responsibilities in the cloud will directly affect your everyday work as a cloud pentester! You must understand<a id="_idIndexMarker029"/> what you’re allowed to do, what you’re forbidden to do, and why. Let’s examine the security responsibilities and the shared <span class="No-Break">responsibility model.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-24"><a id="_idTextAnchor023"/>Security responsibilities in the cloud</h1>
			<p>As a cloud pentester, it’s important<a id="_idIndexMarker030"/> for you to understand how the shared responsibility model<a id="_idIndexMarker031"/> works in the cloud. The two entities involved are the organization that’s using cloud services, and the cloud provider. When you conduct red team engagements, the organization is the entity you report to, whether you’re an employee or a <span class="No-Break">third-party contractor.</span></p>
			<p>Overall, the organization and the cloud provider have shared security responsibilities. This is often called the shared responsibility model. However, cloud security controls and responsibilities are divided between the <span class="No-Break">two entities.</span></p>
			<p>It’s important for you to understand what the cloud provider is responsible for and what the organization you’re working for is responsible for. At the beginning of each pentest or red team engagement, you will sign a contract that outlines the scope of the pentests and what you’re allowed and not allowed to do. You absolutely must abide by the contract and only pentest within your assigned scope. When you pentest a cloud network, you’re not just simulating cyber attacks in your employer’s environment. You’re also simulating cyber attacks within AWS, Azure, or GCP’s infrastructure. The cloud providers have their own rules for what you’re allowed and not allowed to do. If you’ve pentested on-premises networks before, you may find that your scope and permissions are more limited when pentesting a <span class="No-Break">cloud environment.</span></p>
			<p>You must make absolutely certain that you understand each cloud provider’s penetration testing policies. You should definitely read the contracts you sign with your employer very carefully, but you should also do your own research to verify what each cloud platform allows you to do. It’s possible that the organization you’re working for might ask you to perform pentests in a way that the cloud provider’s policies forbid. In these situations, abiding by the cloud provider’s policies is the top priority. Explain to your employer when the pentests they ask for violate the cloud provider’s policies. Then, you and the organization you work for can modify your pentesting plans so that they’re compliant with the cloud <span class="No-Break">provider’s policies.</span></p>
			<p>On all three major platforms—AWS, Azure, and GCP—the platform is responsible for the security “<em class="italic">of the cloud</em>,” while your organization is responsible for security “<em class="italic">in </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">the cloud</em></span><span class="No-Break">.”</span></p>
			<p>The cloud platforms are always responsible for the security of their physical infrastructure and facilities. For instance, if a malicious attacker is able to enter a data center while pretending to be their employee and steals a bunch of data storage devices, the cloud provider is completely liable for that. How could your organization possibly be responsible for that attack? No one in your organization physically visits the cloud provider’s data centers in the <span class="No-Break">first place.</span></p>
			<p>Your organization<a id="_idIndexMarker032"/> is always responsible for the security of the software<a id="_idIndexMarker033"/> your organization develops and maintains. Your organization is also responsible for the security of any software that the cloud provider doesn’t give you. For instance, if you use a cloud service where<a id="_idIndexMarker034"/> AWS, Azure, or GCP provide you with their own <strong class="bold">virtual machines</strong> (<strong class="bold">VMs</strong>), then the security of the operating systems in those VMs is the cloud provider’s responsibility. But if your organization installs its own VMs within the cloud provider’s infrastructure, then the security of those VMs belongs completely to your organization. If I don’t have root or administrator access to the host, I cannot be responsible for keeping the VM up to date; that would be on the cloud provider. If the cloud provider gave me a VM and root or administrator access, I would be responsible for keeping it up to date. There are cloud-specific deployments of VMs that are fully supported to update by the cloud provider, but that’s not always the case. If your organization uses the cloud platform’s APIs, the applications that your organization uses are its responsibility, but the cloud platform’s software and services that the APIs connect to are the cloud <span class="No-Break">platform’s responsibility.</span></p>
			<p>Generally speaking, the division of the shared responsibility model correlates with whether the service your organization is using is IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS. If AWS, Azure, or GCP are offering your organization a SaaS, the cloud provider has most of the responsibility, and what you’re allowed to do as a pentester is the most limited. If AWS, Azure, or GCP are offering your organization an IaaS, your organization has most of the responsibility and you’ll be allowed to do a lot more when you simulate cyber attacks as a pentester. And PaaS is somewhere in <span class="No-Break">the middle.</span></p>
			<p>According to AWS’s shared<a id="_idIndexMarker035"/> responsibility model, your organization is responsible for the security of customer data, your organization’s own platforms, applications, and <strong class="bold">identity and access management</strong> (<strong class="bold">IAM</strong>) systems, your organization’s own operating systems, network and firewall configurations, client-side data, encryption, data integrity authentication, server-side encryption, and networking traffic protection. AWS is responsible for its compute, storage, database, and networking software and all of its hardware and <span class="No-Break">global infrastructure.</span></p>
			<p>According to Azure’s shared responsibility model, your organization is always responsible for its information and data, its PC and mobile devices, and its accounts and identities. Azure is always responsible for its physical hosts, physical network, and physical data center. Depending on whether your Azure service is SaaS, PaaS, or IaaS, responsibilities for identity and directory infrastructure, applications, network controls, and operating systems <span class="No-Break">can vary.</span></p>
			<p>According to GCP’s shared responsibility model, your organization is always responsible for its content and access policies. That applies to SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS services alike. If your GCP service is PaaS, your organization is also responsible for usage, deployment, and web application security. If your GCP service is IaaS, your organization has all of the responsibilities of SaaS and PaaS, and your organization is also responsible for identity, operations, access and authentication, network security, guest operating systems, data, and content. GCP is always responsible for audit logging, its own network, storage and encryption, hardened kernels and IPC, the booting process, and its <span class="No-Break">own hardware.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s briefly summarize<a id="_idIndexMarker036"/> each cloud<a id="_idIndexMarker037"/> provider’s pentesting policies. Links to their pentesting policies on the web will also be provided in the <em class="italic">Further reading</em> section of <a href="B18672_13.xhtml#_idTextAnchor229"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 13</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Best Practices and Summary</em>. Be sure to verify their policies directly from their website in case their <span class="No-Break">policies change.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-25"><a id="_idTextAnchor024"/>AWS</h2>
			<p>AWS permits pentesting as long<a id="_idIndexMarker038"/> as you abide by its policies. Neither you nor the organization you’re working for need to contact AWS about your pentest. As long as you abide by AWS’s policies, you can conduct pentests and red team engagements <span class="No-Break">as needed.</span></p>
			<p>These are the AWS services you’re <em class="italic">permitted</em> to pentest (provided you abide by AWS’s <span class="No-Break">policies) (</span><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/security/penetration-testing/"><span class="No-Break">https://aws.amazon.com/security/penetration-testing/</span></a><span class="No-Break">):</span></p>

			<p>If you’re pentesting as part of a red team, you’re conducting adversarial security simulations. If you plan to conduct an adversarial security simulation within AWS, you must submit a Simulated Events form for AWS to decide whether or not to grant you and your organization permission. The Simulated Events form can be found within your AWS console. Please search for <span class="No-Break">it there.</span></p>
			<p>Network stress testing<a id="_idIndexMarker040"/> entails a performance test that sends a large volume of legitimate traffic in order to test how well your AWS services will function under those conditions. Amazon EC2 has a specific network stress test policy for those situations. You’ll find a link to it in the <em class="italic">Further reading</em> section of <a href="B18672_13.xhtml#_idTextAnchor229"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 13</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Best Practices </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">and Summary</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>DDoS attacks are when a cyber threat actor deliberately and maliciously overwhelms a network target with traffic in order to force it to go out of service. A DDoS attack simulation may be a part of your red team engagement. AWS has a specific DDoS attack simulation <span class="No-Break">policy (</span><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/security/ddos-simulation-testing/"><span class="No-Break">https://aws.amazon.com/security/ddos-simulation-testing/</span></a><span class="No-Break">).</span></p>
			<p>Simulated phishing (social engineering attacks that try to obtain sensitive information from human users) and malware testing may also be parts of your red team engagement. In those situations, you must submit a Simulated Events form for AWS to decide whether or not to grant you and your <span class="No-Break">organization permission.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-26"><a id="_idTextAnchor025"/>Azure</h2>
			<p>Microsoft Cloud (including but not limited to Azure) permits<a id="_idIndexMarker041"/> pentesting as long as you abide by its policies. Neither you nor the organization you’re working for needs to contact Microsoft about your pentest, as long as you abide by Microsoft Cloud’s policies, conduct pentests, and red team engagements as needed. Microsoft Cloud includes Azure Active Directory (which is being renamed Microsoft Entra ID), Microsoft Intune, Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Dynamics 365, Microsoft Power Platform, Microsoft Account, Office 365, and <span class="No-Break">Azure DevOps.</span></p>
			<p>Microsoft Cloud <em class="italic">forbids</em> the following activities<a id="_idIndexMarker042"/> in pentests and red <span class="No-Break">team engagements:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Scanning or testing assets belonging to any other Microsoft <span class="No-Break">Cloud customers.</span></li>

			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-27"><a id="_idTextAnchor026"/>GCP</h2>
			<p>GCP permits pentesting as long<a id="_idIndexMarker048"/> as you abide by its policies. Neither you nor the organization you’re working for need to contact GCP about your pentest. As long as you abide by GCP’s policies, you can conduct pentests and red team engagements as needed.

			<p>Each cloud provider offers a wide range of products and services. Whether a service is IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS, these categorizations affect how your organization uses them and what you may or may not do as a pentester. Let’s explore the different types of <span class="No-Break">cloud services.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-28"><a id="_idTextAnchor027"/>The difference between IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS</h1>
			<p>All of the services provided<a id="_idIndexMarker049"/> by AWS, Azure, and GCP <a id="_idIndexMarker050"/>are either SaaS, PaaS, or IaaS. The classification<a id="_idIndexMarker051"/> of each<a id="_idIndexMarker052"/> of these cloud<a id="_idIndexMarker053"/> services<a id="_idIndexMarker054"/> will directly affect what you’re allowed to do when you’re pentesting, as I’ve explained. So, understanding the differences between these types of services <span class="No-Break">is crucial!</span></p>
			<p>SaaS means the cloud provider<a id="_idIndexMarker055"/> gives your organization lots of components—the infrastructure<a id="_idIndexMarker056"/> everything runs on, its software platform<a id="_idIndexMarker057"/> and related APIs, and<a id="_idIndexMarker058"/> the application-level functions<a id="_idIndexMarker059"/> of its software. For instance, when we use Gmail, we’re using a fully SaaS<a id="_idIndexMarker060"/> application. AWS defines <span class="No-Break">SaaS thus:</span></p>
			<p class="author-quote">“SaaS is a business and software delivery model that enables organizations to offer their solution in a low-friction, service-centric approach.”</p>
			<p>So, your organization is putting its data into the service, but it isn’t doing much—or any—software application development. Your organization’s security concerns with SaaS are mainly how your organization configures it and what data your organization decides to put into the service. As a pentester, you’ll be limited in what you’re allowed to do. But simulating cyber attacks that don’t penetrate into the cloud provider’s own platform is usually okay, as is testing different <span class="No-Break">SaaS configurations.</span></p>
			<p>PaaS essentially offers your organization the cloud provider’s infrastructure and platform. You can think of the cloud provider’s platform as being somewhat analogous to an operating system, but not exactly the same thing. This is how AWS <span class="No-Break">defines PaaS:</span></p>
			<p class="author-quote">“PaaS remove the need for organizations to manage the underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems) and allows you to focus on the deployment and management of your applications. This helps you be more efficient as you don’t need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, or any of the other undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in running your application<em class="italic">.</em>”</p>
			<p>IaaS gives your organization the cloud provider’s infrastructure, which includes its servers, networking devices, and physical networks. The vast majority of the software and data your organization uses belongs to your organization. As <span class="No-Break">AWS explains:</span></p>
			<p class="author-quote">“IaaS, sometimes abbreviated as IaaS, contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT and typically provide access to networking features, computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space.”</p>
			<p>As a pentester, you’ll be allowed to do more in your simulated cyber attacks within each cloud provider’s <span class="No-Break">IaaS services.</span></p>
			<p>So, you now understand<a id="_idIndexMarker061"/> hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, all-cloud, IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, cloud<a id="_idIndexMarker062"/> migration, and many<a id="_idIndexMarker063"/> of the various different ways organizations<a id="_idIndexMarker064"/> use the sorts of cloud<a id="_idIndexMarker065"/> networks<a id="_idIndexMarker066"/> you will <span class="No-Break">be pentesting.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-29"><a id="_idTextAnchor028"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>So, with this chapter, you now understand the basic nature of your testing targets—cloud networks. Later on in this book, I’ll explain more information you’ll need to know as a red teamer that’s specific to AWS, Azure, and GCP. But in the next chapter, we’ll explore how cloud networks in general are cyber-attacked. In a cloud pentest, the cloud is the “what” and your simulated cyber attacks are <span class="No-Break">the “how.”</span></p>
