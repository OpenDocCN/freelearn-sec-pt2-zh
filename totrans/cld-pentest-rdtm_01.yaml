    you’re new to cybersecurity, penetration testing cloud networks requires specialized
    knowledge. One of the key differences between penetration testing cloud networks
    and penetration testing on-premises networks and computer systems is that the
    organization you’re working for doesn’t own everything in its computing environment.
    When you conduct red team engagements in cloud networks, both the organization
    you work for and its cloud provider (whether that's **Amazon Web Services** (**AWS**),
    Azure, or **Google Cloud Platform** (**GCP**)) have needs that must be respected.
    The good news is if you master the skill of pentesting cloud networks, you may
    have a lucrative career ahead of you. Organizations use the cloud now more than
    ever, and demand for cloud services continues to grow.

    of its owner, in order to find security vulnerabilities that an attacker can discover.
    The company that hires you to **penetration test** (**pentest**) will have likely
    already performed vulnerability assessments and audits on their network. A lot
    of security vulnerabilities can be found through assessments and auditing. Pentesting
    is a hands-on review for finding additional security vulnerabilities that may
    have been missed.

    on a regular basis. Your company’s cybersecurity team may become aware of new
    cyber threats and **advanced persistent threats** (**APTs**) from the **security
    operations center** (**SOC**) or the broader cybersecurity community. The red
    team will be informed of particular emerging threats and be asked to simulate
    them. By doing that, the red team will discover vulnerabilities that the emerging
    attackers may exploit. Those discoveries are shared with the defensive security
    team, who will security harden their network accordingly before the threat strikes
    their organization. For instance, a new ransomware group may make news headlines.
    It’s the red team’s job to research how the new ransomware group operates. Then,
    the next step is for them to pretend to be that new ransomware group in their
    next red team engagement. The red team, the offensive security specialists, will
    probably be kept pretty busy year-round, because lots of new cyber attack groups
    and cyber threats emerge every year, every month, every week, and every day!

    took its current form in 2006\. Microsoft Azure and GCP have been around since
    2008\. These three cloud platforms are the most frequently used by businesses
    and enterprises of all kinds, all around the world. Most enterprises use at least
    one cloud platform in their networks these days. Some enterprises even use multiple
    cloud platforms. So, what are cloud platforms, and why are they so popular? How

    machines and networking infrastructure would have to be procured, and they would
    need a lot more physical space for them to occupy. If their capacity needs shrank
    quite a bit, a lot of expensive server machines, networking infrastructure, and
    physical space would have to go to waste. There are a lot of inconveniences, inefficiencies,

    with load balancing to deploy applications through networks in a scalable and
    dynamic way that uses server machines more efficiently. When an operating system
    is virtualized, it runs like an application within another operating system with
    simulated hardware specifications. Load balancing distributes network traffic
    across multiple server machines, and it prevents server overload by improving
    application availability and responsiveness. Each container has operating system
    components and is part of an application. Containers run within a containerization
    orchestration platform and a host operating system or direct hypervisor. Because
    containers are self-sufficient virtualized entities, an application might use
    a large number of them at any given time, and any individual container might only
    live for a few days. Containers can be quickly launched and terminated according
    to what a cloud application needs as it operates continuously.

    orchestration platforms that are best supported by AWS, Azure, and GCP. As containerization

    their applications. It’s a predominant method for developing applications intended
    for cloud deployments. By merging the development and operations (IT) teams, DevOps
    fosters continuous collaboration. The teams patch applications and deploy new
    features in small pieces, and very frequently. Instead of releasing version 1.5
    of an application one year and version 1.6 the next, applications can be updated
    several times per month. DevOps complements agile application development, so
    applications are deployed more efficiently and responsively. It’s possible to
    use the DevOps methodology without the cloud, but the cloud makes it much more
    feasible. You will likely be pentesting DevOps applications at least at some point
    as a cloud pentester. And because of how frequently DevOps applications change,
    that’ll keep you very busy. DevSecOps is when security is implemented into DevOps,
    and you’ll quite possibly be a part of the Sec component of the process.

    and the rest of its network is all on cloud services. Call it entirely cloud,
    cloud-first, cloud-only, or something else. Whether termed as fully cloud-based,
    cloud-first, cloud-only, or any other name, this shift away from on-premises backend
    systems is an emerging industry trend. For the sake of clarity, the backend functions
    of a network are everything that has to run as a server. That includes databases,
    web servers, email servers, authentication system servers, and any computer networking
    function that would typically run in a data center rather than inside someone’s
    office. Those sorts of needs can theoretically all be run from cloud services,
    whereas people’s phones, tablets, and PCs (client devices) serve as frontend devices
    when they’re connected to the network. If I had to physically enter a data center
    in order to check my email on my phone, I’d find that to be very inconvenient!

    of cloud services from the mid-2000s onward. However, any new function or service
    is deployed on the cloud, and older services and applications are migrated to

    effective redundancy. Uptime is the most important metric when it comes to operating
    any sort of network. Redundancy is an effective way to reduce operational downtime.
    For instance, if a server has a technical problem that puts it out of service,
    an identical server elsewhere can ensure that its functions keep running. An enterprise
    may find that having some network infrastructure that it physically controls is
    good for redundancy. Of course, it cannot physically control cloud servers; it
    can only physically control the servers that are on its premises. The same applies
    to networking infrastructure. Cloud providers give organizations a lot of control
    over the parts of their networks that run on cloud infrastructure, but they cannot
    allow an organization’s network administrators to walk into one of their cloud
    data centers and physically turn a server machine off and on again. Other reasons
    why an organization may prefer to maintain a hybrid network are **disaster recovery**
    (**DR**) or regulatory compliance. There may be details in its DR procedures or
    in the regulations it needs to comply with that require it to have physical access
    to some of its network.

- en: Some organizations may have **service-level agreements** (**SLAs**) with vendors
    that predate their usage of cloud services. An SLA is a legal agreement between
    a vendor and a client that outlines the services the client expects to receive,
    the services the vendor agrees to deliver, and the metrics they’ll use to measure
    performance. A vendor can be anything from a cloud platform (such as AWS) or any
    other sort of IT service (such as Slack or Cloudflare). Old SLAs can sometimes
    make cloud migration tricky. So, some enterprises may wait until their older contracts
    expire before going all-cloud. In the meantime, they may find a compromise where
    they maintain their on-premises infrastructure for a period of time while they
    implement cloud services into their network.

    or critical data operations on-premises. Sensitive data and systems can include

    highly sensitive financial or medical data that organizations must keep on their
    premises in order to be regulatory compliant.

    of AWS and Azure, or AWS, Azure, and GCP combined. A multi-cloud network may also
    be a hybrid cloud network if the enterprise also has an on-premises component.
    Either way, the parts of their network on different cloud platforms have to be
    connected in some way. Otherwise, they have multiple networks. When you conduct
    red team engagements for your organization, the reasons for their cloud strategy
    matter. It’ll help you understand how it uses its cloud network, which will help
    you understand how cyber threats may impact the organization. Those are the sort
    of cyber threats you should be simulating in your pentesting. So, let’s examine

    don’t require capital expenditures; their accountants can budget it as an operational
    expenditure. From the business end, they’re not paying for products; they’re paying
    for services. There can be taxation and legal benefits to making a service an
    operational expenditure rather than a capital expenditure. Public cloud services
    are usually more scalable because there are no dedicated physical or virtual server
    machines involved. Enterprises can efficiently use as much or as little space
    as they need at any given time as long as they’re willing to pay the service fees.
    Public cloud services also involve less overhead for a business because a third
    party is responsible for maintaining the infrastructure.

- en: One of the main reasons why an organization may require private cloud services
    is cybersecurity. As with having any other sort of on-premises component in other
    types of hybrid cloud networks, regulatory compliance may mandate private instead
    of public cloud usage. Because an enterprise has exclusive use of a private cloud,
    it can maintain more control and implement stricter security measures. The regulations
    it may need to comply with are even more likely to apply to sensitive financial
    or medical data. For instance, using a private cloud rather than a public cloud
    may be necessary for the **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act**
    (**HIPAA**) (a set of medical data regulations in the United States), or Sarbanes–Oxley
    (a set of financial data regulations in the United States) compliance in some
    situations. Also, as with non-cloud on-premises network usage, an organization
    may choose to deploy the cloud computing model on its own infrastructure for its
    DR needs.

    need to connect to the client machines on an enterprise’s premises through private
    networking—often through some sort of **virtual private** **network** (**VPN**).

    the world has shown that many millions of people have left the workforce worldwide
    due to early death and long-term disability from long COVID. Employees have found
    better safety and productivity by working from home instead of having to work
    on-site. Smart employers want to keep their workers healthy and productive and
    understand the benefits of protecting them from airborne disease. Facilitating
    working from home with cloud migration is an effective strategy.

    don’t have to pay for additional real estate to provide spaces to run their own
    massive data centers. Amazon, Google, and Microsoft have many of the largest data
    centers on Earth, on all populated continents. From India to Japan, from the United
    States to Indonesia, from France to South Africa, many people and employers work
    within 1,000 kilometers of an AWS, GCP, or Azure data center. But even employers
    who are 5,000 kilometers from their nearest cloud platform data center still enjoy
    fast data transfer and minimal latency. Plus, all three cloud providers add new
    data centers to more parts of the globe each and every year. For many companies,
    replacing their own on-premises data centers with the flexibility and agility
    of operating in the cloud is an obvious choice. The reduction in capital expenditures
    also measurably improves their bottom line.

    to facilitate DR (because they’ll have physical access to some of their infrastructure),
    other companies cite DR as a reason to migrate to the cloud. This shows how complex
    and nuanced many of these practicalities of operating enterprise networks can
    be in the real world. AWS, Azure, and GCP all have DR tools and advise companies
    on how to use them effectively. The massive capacity of their data centers makes
    it easier and more affordable for companies to maintain backups of petabytes’
    and exabytes’ worth of data. The cloud platforms also offer useful tools for organizations
    to periodically test the viability of their backups, and also to store different
    types of snapshots. If an organization keeps none of its backend on its premises,
    its data can be kept safer if its premises are hit by a flood, fire, or earthquake.
    Amazon, Google, and Microsoft also build redundancy and resiliency into their
    own networks. They have systems in place for operation if a disaster strikes one
    of their international data centers. Plus, their physical security is hardened
    beyond what most organizations can afford to do themselves for their own premises.

    model works in the cloud. The two entities involved are the organization that’s
    using cloud services, and the cloud provider. When you conduct red team engagements,
    the organization is the entity you report to, whether you’re an employee or a
    third-party contractor.

    This is often called the shared responsibility model. However, cloud security
    controls and responsibilities are divided between the two entities.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s important for you to understand what the cloud provider is responsible
    for and what the organization you’re working for is responsible for. At the beginning
    of each pentest or red team engagement, you will sign a contract that outlines
    the scope of the pentests and what you’re allowed and not allowed to do. You absolutely
    must abide by the contract and only pentest within your assigned scope. When you
    pentest a cloud network, you’re not just simulating cyber attacks in your employer’s
    environment. You’re also simulating cyber attacks within AWS, Azure, or GCP’s
    infrastructure. The cloud providers have their own rules for what you’re allowed
    and not allowed to do. If you’ve pentested on-premises networks before, you may
    find that your scope and permissions are more limited when pentesting a cloud
    environment.
  prefs: []

    testing policies. You should definitely read the contracts you sign with your
    employer very carefully, but you should also do your own research to verify what
    each cloud platform allows you to do. It’s possible that the organization you’re
    working for might ask you to perform pentests in a way that the cloud provider’s
    policies forbid. In these situations, abiding by the cloud provider’s policies
    is the top priority. Explain to your employer when the pentests they ask for violate
    the cloud provider’s policies. Then, you and the organization you work for can
    modify your pentesting plans so that they’re compliant with the cloud provider’s
    policies.

    infrastructure and facilities. For instance, if a malicious attacker is able to
    enter a data center while pretending to be their employee and steals a bunch of
    data storage devices, the cloud provider is completely liable for that. How could
    your organization possibly be responsible for that attack? No one in your organization
    physically visits the cloud provider’s data centers in the first place.

- en: Your organization is always responsible for the security of the software your
    organization develops and maintains. Your organization is also responsible for
    the security of any software that the cloud provider doesn’t give you. For instance,
    if you use a cloud service where AWS, Azure, or GCP provide you with their own
    **virtual machines** (**VMs**), then the security of the operating systems in
    those VMs is the cloud provider’s responsibility. But if your organization installs
    its own VMs within the cloud provider’s infrastructure, then the security of those
    VMs belongs completely to your organization. If I don’t have root or administrator
    access to the host, I cannot be responsible for keeping the VM up to date; that
    would be on the cloud provider. If the cloud provider gave me a VM and root or
    administrator access, I would be responsible for keeping it up to date. There
    are cloud-specific deployments of VMs that are fully supported to update by the
    cloud provider, but that’s not always the case. If your organization uses the
    cloud platform’s APIs, the applications that your organization uses are its responsibility,
    but the cloud platform’s software and services that the APIs connect to are the
    cloud platform’s responsibility.

    with whether the service your organization is using is IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS. If
    AWS, Azure, or GCP are offering your organization a SaaS, the cloud provider has
    most of the responsibility, and what you’re allowed to do as a pentester is the
    most limited. If AWS, Azure, or GCP are offering your organization an IaaS, your
    organization has most of the responsibility and you’ll be allowed to do a lot
    more when you simulate cyber attacks as a pentester. And PaaS is somewhere in
