    that are designed to find vulnerabilities in computer networks and applications.
    The biggest difference between a pentest and an actual cyberattack is that the
    former is conducted with the full consent of the owner of the computer or network,
    whereas the latter isn’t.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As a pentester or red team member, not only will you need consent from the owner
    of the target you’re testing, but you’ll also have to sign a legal agreement that
    explains in detail what you’re allowed to do, what you’re forbidden from doing,
    and the scope of your pentest. This applies whether you’re an employee of the
    organization being pentested, a third-party contractor of the organization being
    pentested, someone who conducts simple one-off pentests, or a red team member
    who pentests as part of your red team engagements.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Whether or not an organization has a red team, it will commence pentesting after
    a history of vulnerability assessments. A vulnerability assessment is the first
    way to find security vulnerabilities. It analyzes the state of an application
    or network based on checklists of criteria. The criteria are most often based
    on a set security standard, such as the **OWASP Application Security Verification
    Standard** ([https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/))
    or the **PCI PTS POI Modular Security Requirements** ([https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/PTS_POI_v6.2_Bulletin.pdf](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/PTS_POI_v6.2_Bulletin.pdf)).
    There are hundreds of different security standards that could apply to the organization
    you work for. Vulnerability assessments are appropriate for all businesses and
    enterprises, at all possible security maturity levels. Security maturity is a
    complex concept, but in a nutshell, it’s about how well developed an organization’s
    security policies and controls are.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once an organization has done some vulnerability assessments, security-hardened
    its networks based on those findings, and assembled a team of cybersecurity professionals,
    then it may be ready for pentesting. Pentesting is supposed to discover security
    vulnerabilities that can only be discovered by simulating cyberattacks. Legally
    and procedure-wise, pentesting is a lot different from cyber attacking, but the
    computers and networks you pentest don’t know the difference. Your pentests will
    break things, even if the effects are as temporary as taking a few computers offline
    for an hour in a **denial-of-service** (**DoS**) attack. That’s why only organizations
    with some security maturity should be pentesting, and it’s also why a specific
    scope is always agreed upon before starting a pentest. For instance, your organization
    may move its production from one network segment to another so you can pentest
    within a segment without interfering with its everyday operations.

    frequent pentests according to patterns in the cyber threat landscape. As an example,
    if a new enterprise ransomware threat emerges, your red team may be tasked with
    simulating that particular new ransomware within your network and seeing what
    happens.

    the right way and in the right situations will help you pentest effectively, finding
    vulnerabilities that your organization must address. But the greatest tools in
    the world are only good if you know how to use them and why. You’ll also sometimes
    conduct some activities without those tools. In all scenarios, you must understand

    by phishing scams, digital surveillance, and malware. An ordinary person may be
    exploited to pay a cyber attacker a few hundred dollars’ worth of cryptocurrency
    in a ransomware attack. Even small businesses may have revenue in the millions
    of dollars, and they could be coerced into paying a cyber attacker a million-dollar

    drive-by compromise happens when a user visits a website through their usual web
    browsing activities. An attacker with control of the website uses it to attack
    the user through their web browser. Sometimes, attackers also use this technique
    for malicious actions that aren’t exploits, such as acquiring application access

    describes it as when adversaries take advantage of internet-connected computers
    or applications through their vulnerabilities. Frequent means of exploitation
    include SQL databases, standard internet services such as SSH or SMB, network
    management protocols, and applications with internet-accessible open sockets such
    as web browsers. But other internet-connected technologies can also be used in

    MITRE ATT&CK ([https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1133/](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1133/))
    describes it as when attackers target external services to acquire malicious access
    or maintain persistence in a network. Commonly targeted remote services include
    VPNs, Citrix, or similar technologies that facilitate remote access. Attackers
    often need access to valid accounts for their targeted service in order for this
    exploit to work. Access to valid accounts can be acquired by stealing credentials
    through already compromised networks or means such as credential pharming. Of
    course, in external cyberattacks, access to a valid account may be acquired by
    phishing an employee. Phishing attacks take many forms, but they most often use
    fake websites, fake emails, fake text messages, or fake social media posts to
    imitate a trusted entity.

    cyberattacks, known as “valid accounts.” According to MITRE ATT&CK ([https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/)),
    attackers can acquire malicious access to computer systems by compromising legitimate
    user accounts that have privileges within them. They may also compromise privileged
    accounts to establish persistence, for privilege escalation, or for defense evasion.
    Sometimes, inactive user accounts are also exploited. Network administrators should
    watch the behavior of the accounts in their system and deactivate user accounts

    contractor, executive, or supply chain entity to help them with their cyberattack.

    If they work for the organization, they have a user account in your network and
    applications that at least has some privileges, even if they’re minimal. They
    very likely have physical access to the company’s computers and on-premises network.
    That can make it a lot easier to attack the cloud network. A supply chain entity
    also already has privileged access to an organization that an outsider won’t have.
    Your organization’s supply chain consists of the other businesses that provide
    products and services to your organization – for instance, companies that make
    metal and sell it to car manufacturers. The metal manufacturer is part of the
    car manufacturer’s supply chain. The web development firm that makes custom web
    applications for a school is a part of the school’s supply chain.

    to overwhelm a network target with more data than it can handle. Overwhelming
    a target with data can cause it to shut down or go offline temporarily. Web servers
    and cloud instances are some of the most common targets of DDoS attacks.

    that a cyber attacker controls through a command-and-control server in order to
    execute cyberattacks. Computers get infected with zombie malware that makes them
    controllable by the attacker and part of the botnet. PCs, mobile devices, servers,
    and networking devices such as routers are often infected with zombie malware
    and used in a botnet. An ordinary person’s phone could be part of a botnet and
    they don’t even know it!

    internal network and all of its segments were contained within a heavily guarded
    perimeter. Sometimes, external traffic would be allowed into the internal network,
    but it’d have to pass a vector for authentication and authorization. But once
    that perimeter was cleared, the user could travel within the internal network
    without having their credentials checked again. All users were either trusted
    or distrusted, and existing inside the perimeter meant automatic trust. Think

    Cyber attackers do sometimes breach authentication barriers. So, if they breach

    cloud network has a few PC endpoints on-premises and connects to one cloud service
    on one cloud platform through the internet. The most complex hybrid multi-cloud
    networks entail on-premises networks and endpoints in multiple company-owned locations,
    remote employees and contractors working from their homes, multiple cloud services
    (AWS, Azure, and GCP), and several different SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS services and

    A perimeter security network automatically trusts users inside of the perimeter.
    But in cloud networks and over the internet, there is no perimeter. So, authentication

    network as possible. It doesn’t matter where you come from, you must show your

    become effortless for them. Grasping these nuances is essential for anyone involved
