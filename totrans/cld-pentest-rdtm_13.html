			<h1 id="_idParaDest-230"><a id="_idTextAnchor230"/>Best Practices and Summary</h1>
			<p>So, we’ve learned about the most popular cloud platforms—AWS, Azure, and GCP. We’ve also tried out a bunch of vulnerability scanning and pentesting exercises in our own test AWS, Azure, and <span class="No-Break">GCP deployments.</span></p>
			<p>Now, let’s review what we’ve learned. We’ll also give you useful information about professional certifications, pentesting contracts, and pentest reports. In this chapter, we’ll cover a content review with questions and answers based on the material that appeared earlier in this book, what you should have in your cloud pentesting toolkit, and useful cloud and pentesting certifications that you <span class="No-Break">can pursue.</span></p>
			<p>We will also discuss what should be included in a pentesting contract and how to write an effective <span class="No-Break">pentest report.</span></p>
			<p>We’ll cover the following <span class="No-Break">main topics:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Content review</span></li>
				<li>Your cloud <span class="No-Break">pentesting toolkit</span></li>
				<li>Cloud and <span class="No-Break">pentester certifications</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Pentesting contracts</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Pentesting reports</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let’s jump <span class="No-Break">right in!</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-231"><a id="_idTextAnchor231"/>Content review</h1>
			<p>You have learned <a id="_idIndexMarker1044"/>so much from reading this book! We’ve covered not just one cloud platform, but the three most used cloud platforms around—AWS, Azure, and GCP. Plus, you’ve read a lot about the basic principles and concepts in penetration testing and red teaming, and how to share your security vulnerability discoveries with defensive cybersecurity specialists and <span class="No-Break">corporate leadership.</span></p>
			<p>That’s a lot <a id="_idIndexMarker1045"/>of information to absorb. You will probably read bits of this book again from time to time during your first few years working as a cloud pentester. However, in order to prepare for your professional journey, it’s important to see whether you can remember what you’ve learned. The human brain is more likely to remember information when it thinks in more than one way. So far, you’ve absorbed information, and then put your learning into practice by trying out the many pentesting tutorials in this book. Now, it’s time to recall what you’ve learned so that you can track your progress and be more likely <span class="No-Break">to remember.</span></p>
			<p>Fortunately, this isn’t a formal examination. It’s just an exercise for your own benefit. Don’t be hard on yourself if you answer some of these questions incorrectly. You’ll discover areas that you need to focus on in order to improve. The learning process always involves learning <span class="No-Break">from mistakes!</span></p>
			<p>Okay—let’s get <span class="No-Break">into it!</span></p>

(This excludes tools that can only be used in one of the cloud platforms, such as MFASweep for Microsoft Azure or Pacu <span class="No-Break">for AWS.)</span></li>
			</ol>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-233"><a id="_idTextAnchor233"/>Answers</h2>
			<p>Here are the answers <a id="_idIndexMarker1046"/>to the <span class="No-Break">preceding questions:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>A multi-cloud network<a id="_idIndexMarker1047"/> is a cloud network that uses more than one cloud platform. A multi-cloud network could have AWS and GCP, Azure and AWS, AWS, Azure, and GCP, and it could also entail cloud platforms that aren’t covered in this book, such as DigitalOcean, Salesforce, IBM Cloud, Oracle Cloud, Rackspace Cloud, and many others. A company’s cloud network with any combination of two or more cloud providers is a multi-cloud network. Organizations often deploy multi-cloud networks because they may want to have functionality or applications that are only provided by one cloud platform. For instance, a company may use Microsoft Azure for its native Active Directory support for its Windows Server machines on its premises, and GCP for its native support for Google Maps and other Google service APIs. AWS, Azure, and GCP all have the ability to be integrated with each other in one big corporate <span class="No-Break">cloud network.</span></li>
				<li>A hybrid cloud network <a id="_idIndexMarker1048"/>combines a cloud network with a network on an organization’s own premises. There has been a huge trend of companies all over the world and in all industries migrating the functions of their on-premises networks to the cloud in the past 10-15 years. But sometimes, organizations find that at least some of their network has to stay on their own servers in their own facilities for a multitude of reasons. AWS, Azure, and GCP are all able to be integrated with a company’s own on-premises network. Hybrid cloud networks may use just one cloud platform, or they can also be multi-cloud networks. Pentesting and red teaming a multi-cloud hybrid network can be especially challenging <span class="No-Break">for pentesters!</span></li>
				<li>An easy way to remember what security responsibilities a cloud provider has and what security responsibilities your organization has is to remember this—the cloud provider is responsible for the security <em class="italic">of</em> the cloud and your organization is responsible for security <em class="italic">in</em> <span class="No-Break">the cloud.</span><p class="list-inset">For example, Amazon has very strong physical security for its various data centers around the world. There are very few people who are allowed inside of one. Even if your company spends $100,000 USD per month on AWS services, it won’t let you inside one of its data centers. The cloud provider is fully responsible for the physical security of its data centers. It is also responsible for securing its networking infrastructure and all of its physical hardware. If a disk drive physically fails, it’s up to the cloud provider to replace it. The cloud provider is also responsible for the software code that it develops <span class="No-Break">and maintains.</span></p><p class="list-inset">Your <a id="_idIndexMarker1049"/>organization is responsible for the security of the software code that you put into cloud infrastructure. Your organization is also responsible for the network traffic you move through it. SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS are categorizations that are all about how much of the code is developed by your organization (or acquired from third-party developers) and how much of it is developed by the cloud provider. So, from that foundation, it’s easy to understand how the shared security responsibility model applies a bit differently to each type of <span class="No-Break">cloud service.</span></p></li>
				<li>Most of the time, you’re forbidden from simulating DDoS attacks in any cloud platform because they may be disruptive to the cloud provider’s other customers. However, AWS will permit DDoS simulation testing in certain circumstances. As per the AWS <em class="italic">DDoS Simulation Testing Policy</em> (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/security/ddos-simulation-testing/">https://aws.amazon.com/security/ddos-simulation-testing/</a>). Some DDoS testing is permitted if the bit volume of the test doesn’t exceed 20 GB per second. If the packet volume doesn’t exceed 5 million packets per second when testing CloudFrunt or 50,000 packets per second when testing other types of AWS resources, the DDoS simulation may not originate from another AWS resource, and AWS may tell your organization to terminate the simulation testing at any time. AWS may make exceptions to these rules <em class="italic">if</em> your organization applies for an exception request <em class="italic">and AWS expressively approves it</em>! If these criteria are too complicated for your red team or pentesters, or if you’re even slightly concerned that your DDoS simulation may be forbidden by a cloud provider, just don’t try it in the first place. It’s not worth it to risk violating a cloud <span class="No-Break">provider’s policies.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">SaaS</strong> means <strong class="bold">Software-as-a-Service</strong>, <strong class="bold">PaaS</strong> means <strong class="bold">Platform-as-a-Service</strong>, and <strong class="bold">IaaS</strong> means <strong class="bold">Infrastructure-as-a-Service</strong>. SaaS means that the cloud provider has <a id="_idIndexMarker1050"/>most of the software code and most of the<a id="_idIndexMarker1051"/> security responsibility—for example, Gmail in the Google ecosystem. PaaS means the provider develops a software foundation for some of your organization’s own code (or code you acquire from a third-party developer). Amazon <strong class="bold">Elastic Kubernetes Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">EKS</strong>) is an <a id="_idIndexMarker1052"/>example of PaaS. Amazon is responsible for its own Amazon EKS code, but your own container images, third-party container images, your containers, and how your organization uses your Kubernetes cluster in Amazon EKS is your organization’s security responsibility. IaaS is when a cloud provider basically just provides the cloud infrastructure. An example of IaaS is Azure VMs, where Microsoft just provides the physical servers and the hypervisor for your organization’s VMs. If a cyber attacker exploits a vulnerability in an operating system in your VM, that’s on your organization, <span class="No-Break">not Microsoft.</span></li>
				<li>External cyber<a id="_idIndexMarker1053"/> attacks originate from outside of your company’s network, whereas internal cyber attacks originate from inside of your company’s network. External cyber attacks include the classic kinds of cyber attacks most people think of. A bad person hacks into your company’s servers through the internet and deploys ransomware. Stuff like that. What’s sometimes forgotten are internal cyber attacks. They come from people and entities that already have privileged access from within your company’s network. They’re often employees, contractors, executives, or trusted supply chain entities. For instance, an employee may suspect that they’re going to be fired soon, so they get revenge by breaching your company’s sensitive data on a public website. Internal cyber attacks can be easier to conduct and more destructive because they don’t have to hack their way into your company’s network; they’re already inside because they’re supposed to be there. However, they may conduct privilege escalation attacks and lateral movement to access parts of the internal network that they’re not allowed <span class="No-Break">to access.</span></li>
				<li>The <a id="_idIndexMarker1054"/>MITRE ATT&amp;CK database (<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/">https://attack.mitre.org/</a>) is a useful and freely available <a id="_idIndexMarker1055"/>resource online to<a id="_idIndexMarker1056"/> learn about cyber exploitation techniques that attackers often use. Most cyber attacks involve more than one exploitation technique as they progress along the attack chain. The database is maintained by the MITRE Corporation, and it’s occasionally updated to include newly discovered cyber <span class="No-Break">exploitation techniques.</span></li>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">CIA</strong> triad <a id="_idIndexMarker1057"/>stands for <strong class="bold">Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability</strong>. Those are the properties of data that cyber attacks harm. All cyber attacks impact one or more of those three components. Confidentiality is all about making sure that data is only accessible to the entities that are permitted access to it. For instance, if an attacker could read my email inbox, that’s an attack on my confidentiality. Integrity is all about making sure only authorized entities can alter data. So, if an attacker used my email to send emails as me, or altered the contents of the emails in my inbox or the emails I’m receiving through the IMAP protocol, that’s an attack on the integrity of my email. Availability is all about making sure that data and data services are usable and accessible when they’re supposed to be. If an attacker DDoS attacks my email server and I can’t receive or send new emails, that’s an attack on the availability of my email. Some attacks impact more than one part of the CIA triad. For instance, enterprise ransomware these days often doesn’t just maliciously encrypt data away from its rightful owners; it also threatens to breach sensitive data to the public if a ransom <span class="No-Break">isn’t paid.</span></li>
				<li>In a<a id="_idIndexMarker1058"/> zero-trust network, no machine, device, or user is automatically trusted, regardless of its origin. Zero-trust networks exist in contrast with the old traditional perimeter security model. In the perimeter security model, there is a security perimeter between the internal network and external networks (such as the internet). Entities originating from external networks need to be authenticated and authorized at the security perimeter in order to be allowed into the internal network, but all data traveling around the internal network and all entities originating from the internal network is automatically trusted. That security model may have worked in the 1990s before cloud computing was a thing, organizations had completely on-premises networks, and the cyber threat landscape was less sophisticated. But with the advent of the cloud and other 21<span class="superscript">st</span>-century computing technologies, only the zero-trust model is effective for good network security, within the cloud and beyond the cloud. Given the way cloud networks <a id="_idIndexMarker1059"/>operate, only the zero-trust model can properly be applied anyway. Plus, it obviously works better for detecting and preventing internal cyber attacks as well. In a zero-trust network, your device is being authenticated at every possible <span class="No-Break">authentication point.</span></li>
				<li>Exposed services are internet services and ports in your organization’s cloud network that an attacker can use to cyber-attack your network through the internet. It’s absolutely crucial that the organization you work for makes sure that it has zero exposed services. The cloud networks that companies operate are constantly changing, so you could have no exposed services today but 20 exposed services next week. Some of the pentesting tools I’ve demonstrated in this book, such as Pacu, have modules that can find exposed services that you can mention in your pentest report. Some of the security tools that the cloud providers make available for their customers, such as Amazon Inspector, can also find <span class="No-Break">exposed services.</span></li>
				<li>A <a id="_idIndexMarker1060"/>vulnerability assessment is when a checklist is used to identify common security weaknesses, misconfigurations, and other vulnerabilities pertaining to a type of computer system. Most of the third-party pentesting tools in this book can be used to perform vulnerability assessments. Some of the checklists that form the basis of a vulnerability assessment include CIS security benchmarks for particular services and applications and security standards such<a id="_idIndexMarker1061"/> as the <strong class="bold">Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard</strong> (<strong class="bold">PCI DSS</strong>) regulations <a id="_idIndexMarker1062"/>for <strong class="bold">point-of-sale</strong> (<strong class="bold">PoS</strong>) computer <span class="No-Break">payment systems.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">IAM</strong> stands for <strong class="bold">Identity and Access Management</strong>. It’s a specialization in cybersecurity<a id="_idIndexMarker1063"/> that has to do with maintaining user accounts and machine identities (such as TLS certificates for encryption), authentication methods such as passwords and biometrics, access control systems such as RBAC, user account permissions, and making sure that users and machines can only access data and systems that they’re authorized to access. It’s an area of cybersecurity expertise that predates cloud networks. However, AWS, Azure, and GCP all have their own IAM systems. Securing IAM is absolutely crucial for the security of your network, applications, and data as <span class="No-Break">a whole!</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">RBAC</strong> stands <a id="_idIndexMarker1064"/>for <strong class="bold">role-based access control</strong>. There are many <a id="_idIndexMarker1065"/>different access control methodologies, such as <strong class="bold">mandatory access control</strong> (<strong class="bold">MAC</strong>), <strong class="bold">rule-based access control</strong>, and <strong class="bold">discretionary access control</strong> (<strong class="bold">DAC</strong>). But <a id="_idIndexMarker1066"/>RBAC is the methodology that’s used in cloud networks the most often. It’s also the access control methodology that’s native to Kubernetes. In<a id="_idIndexMarker1067"/> RBAC, users are put into user groups based on their roles within the organization, and then privileges are assigned to the user groups. For instance, only users in the administrative group may be able to create new user accounts, and only users in the payroll group have access to the payroll server. Users should only be put into particular user groups if they absolutely must have that access for the sake of their jobs; that’s<a id="_idIndexMarker1068"/> the <strong class="bold">principle of least </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">privilege</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> (</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">PoLP</strong></span><span class="No-Break">).</span></li>
				<li>The CVE database (<a href="https://www.cve.org/">https://www.cve.org/</a>) is another freely accessible database that’s<a id="_idIndexMarker1069"/> maintained by the MITRE Corporation. <strong class="bold">CVE</strong> stands for <strong class="bold">Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures</strong>. It’s <a id="_idIndexMarker1070"/>intended to be as comprehensive of a database of known security vulnerabilities as possible. There may be a delay of a few months between an organization discovering a vulnerability in one of its products and it appearing as a record in the CVE database in order to give the organization time to patch the vulnerability before it becomes public knowledge, accessible to potential attackers. CVE records are numbered with this format—CVE-YYYY-NNNN. An example is CVE-2023-1234 (<a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-1234">https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-1234</a>). The year (YYYY) indicates when the number was reserved; it may or may not be the year the vulnerability was discovered or published in the database. NNNN is just a random four-digit number unique to the year, from what I can tell. If the rate at which vulnerabilities enter the database increases, they may have to add a digit. Published vulnerabilities often have patches available, but not always! That’s a scary <a id="_idIndexMarker1071"/>thought. In my work and for the sake of pragmatism, I generally define known vulnerabilities as those that have CVE records. Some of the pentesting and vulnerability scanning tools in this book will identify the vulnerabilities they find by <span class="No-Break">CVE records.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">CVSS</strong> is the <strong class="bold">Common Vulnerability Scoring System</strong> (maintained by FIRST) that’s<a id="_idIndexMarker1072"/> used to classify vulnerabilities in the CVE database according to their severity. The CVSS Score Qualitative Rating uses the following categorizations. 0.0 means the vulnerability is no problem at all (I’ve never seen a 0.0 rating), 0.1 to 3.9 is low, 4.0 to 6.9 is medium, 7.0 to 8.9 is high, and 9.0 to 10.0 is critical. The higher the number, the more dangerous it is for a computer system to be exploited by <span class="No-Break">that vulnerability.</span></li>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">Exploit Prediction Scoring System</strong> (<strong class="bold">EPSS</strong>) is FIRST’s system to describe <a id="_idIndexMarker1073"/>the likelihood or probability that a vulnerability will be exploited by cyber attackers. EPSS scores are given according to a percentage likelihood that a vulnerability will be exploited. A vulnerability may have a CVSS score of 9.5, but if its EPSS score is 5%, it may be a lower priority on your pentest report than a vulnerability with a CVSS score of 5.7 but an EPSS score <span class="No-Break">of 95%.</span></li>
				<li>A red team simulates cyber attacks in its company’s network according to new and emerging cyber threats. A pentesting engagement might only be done once and be conducted over the course of a week or two. Red teaming<a id="_idIndexMarker1074"/> entails constant and continuous red teaming campaigns to simulate ever-evolving cyber threats over time in order to discover vulnerabilities. They’re a type of offensive security specialty. Blue teaming <a id="_idIndexMarker1075"/>is the defensive security equivalent. The blue team consists of defensive security specialists who conduct blue team engagements to simulate strategies to protect their network from <span class="No-Break">cyber attacks.</span></li>
				<li>When you mix red and blue, you <a id="_idIndexMarker1076"/>get purple. Purple teaming is when the red team and the blue team come together to conduct purple team exercises together. The red team simulates cyber attacks while the blue team simulates cyber defense. Purple teaming can be a great way for offensive and defensive security specialists to come together to learn about their organization’s security posture in order to <span class="No-Break">improve it.</span></li>
				<li>A pentest <a id="_idIndexMarker1077"/>report is the product of your pentesting. It’s an extensive <a id="_idIndexMarker1078"/>guide to the vulnerabilities you found over the course of your pentest, how the vulnerabilities can be exploited to harm your organization’s network, and how the vulnerabilities should be triaged and mitigated. All of your hard work as a pentester won’t do any good if you can’t communicate your security findings effectively to the defensive security team and corporate executives so that they know what to do with your information and security <span class="No-Break">harden accordingly.</span></li>
				<li>AWS Security Hub <a id="_idIndexMarker1079"/>is where all of Amazon’s native AWS security services come together. Data is aggregated from AWS IAM, Amazon Macie, AWS Health, AWS Systems Manager, Amazon Inspector, AWS Firewall Manager, Amazon GuardDuty, and AWS Config. You can see live information <a id="_idIndexMarker1080"/>about your company’s security posture in AWS, so it can be helpful to pentesters as well as <span class="No-Break">security administrators.</span></li>
				<li>Amazon Inspector<a id="_idIndexMarker1081"/> is a first-party tool that’s built into AWS that not only provides dynamic security data to be shown in AWS Security Hub but can also be used to conduct vulnerability scans when a security administrator or pentester decides to conduct one. It has some of the functionality of some of the third-party pentesting tools in this book, including classifying vulnerabilities according to CVE records and <span class="No-Break">CVSS scores.</span></li>
				<li>Prowler is a<a id="_idIndexMarker1082"/> third-party security testing tool for pentesters to run a variety of types of vulnerability scans with pre-programmed checks and services. It can be used in AWS, Azure, and GCP. As with all of the third-party tools in this book, Prowler can be run from the command line. Prowler might be the most essential third-party tool in <span class="No-Break">this book.</span></li>
				<li>Pacu<a id="_idIndexMarker1083"/> is a<a id="_idIndexMarker1084"/> third-party tool that’s used for finding security vulnerabilities in AWS. It has a plethora of modules that can be used to simulate a variety of kinds of cyber attacks; it’s no mere <span class="No-Break">vulnerability scanner.</span></li>
				<li>A VM is a virtualized computer that’s just another application as far as your host operating system is concerned. It virtualizes hardware components such as memory, disk storage, and network connections. If my Windows OEM laptop is my computer, a VM is my “computer’s pet computer.” VMs can run from an application within a host operating system, such as a VMware client or Oracle VirtualBox. Or, a hypervisor with multiple VMs can run directly within a computer’s hardware; no host operating system is required. Within a host operating system, a VMware client or Oracle VirtualBox also serves as a hypervisor. I can run multiple VMs on my Windows OEM laptop, and the VMs could use Linux or Mac operating systems if I wanted; the VMs’ operating systems don’t have to match the host operating system. VMs are also commonly used in the cloud. Many cloud providers’ IaaS services are basically everything you need to run your own VMs on the provider’s infrastructure and <span class="No-Break">nothing more.</span></li>
				<li>Containerization is<a id="_idIndexMarker1085"/> another way to use virtualization. A VM runs an operating system with all of said operating system’s components, whereas a container only runs the components that are necessary to execute the code that runs through it. A containerization cluster can contain dozens of containers or more at any given time, responsive to what a cloud application’s needs are at any given moment. Individual containers may only have a lifespan of days. Cloud networks have the infrastructure that’s necessary for organizations to truly benefit from the scalability that containerization <span class="No-Break">makes possible.</span></li>
				<li>Docker is one <a id="_idIndexMarker1086"/>of the more popular containerization orchestration platforms. Here’s how it works. The Docker host runs directly on your computer or on the computer you manage on a cloud service. In the Docker host, the Docker daemon stores Docker images and makes and manages containers based on those images. The Docker host connects to a registry, which is usually hosted on an external network that is most often the internet. A Docker client is where you can execute commands to your <span class="No-Break">Docker daemon.</span></li>
				<li>Kubernetes is another popular<a id="_idIndexMarker1087"/> containerization platform that builds upon the foundation Docker created. Kubernetes clusters contain a control plane, nodes, and Pods. Nodes are supported by the control plane, nodes support Pods, and Pods generate and <span class="No-Break">run containers.</span></li>
				<li>The <a id="_idIndexMarker1088"/>control plane supports the entire containerization system and works as the vector between your Kubernetes-based network and the cloud platform. The control plane contains a handful of components, including <strong class="source-inline">etcd</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">kube-scheduler</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">kube-apiserver</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">kube-controller-manager</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">cloud</strong>, <span class="No-Break">and </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">controller-manager</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
				<li>A container image<a id="_idIndexMarker1089"/> is similar conceptually to the ISO files (disk images) of operating systems that can be installed directly onto a computer or used to make VMs, except container images are specialized to be used to make containers. Container images don’t contain an entire operating system, just the necessary components according to how the container is going to be used. Sometimes, organizations will create their own custom container images. Container images can be acquired by third parties for particular use cases, or you could also use container images that AWS, Azure, and GCP provide <span class="No-Break">for you.</span></li>
				<li>How many pentesting tools you can use on all three cloud platforms were you able to remember? Here are all of the ones that are mentioned in this book: Prowler, ScoutSuite, Vishnunair’s <strong class="source-inline">automated-pentest</strong> (only in Docker), <strong class="source-inline">kube-bench</strong> (only in Kubernetes), <strong class="source-inline">kube-hunter</strong> (only in Kubernetes), <strong class="source-inline">kdigger</strong> (only in Kubernetes), and Trivy (in Docker <span class="No-Break">and Kubernetes).</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Now, let’s look at the tools that you need to do your job while practicing the exercises in this book and while working as a <span class="No-Break">cloud pentester.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-234"><a id="_idTextAnchor234"/>Your cloud pentesting toolkit</h1>
			<p>Here are the<a id="_idIndexMarker1090"/> tools you should have in your cloud pentesting toolkit. You can use those tools to follow the tutorials in this book, and also to conduct real-life cloud <span class="No-Break">penetration testing:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>The majority of Windows and Mac laptop and desktop PCs produced in the past decade work great for your cloud pentesting toolkit. You don’t need to have cutting-edge hardware specs because the cloud network’s computing power does most of the work. If you need me to be more specific, look for a Windows or Mac PC with at least a quadcore 64-bit CPU that’s Intel or AMD x86-64 architecture or Apple M1, and with at least 4 GB of RAM. Ethernet and Wi-Fi networking should also be supported by your computer’s hardware. Windows 8, 10, or 11, macOS 11 Big Sur or later, or any currently supported Debian, Ubuntu, or Fedora Linux operating system work great. It’s also nice to have at least 100 GB of internal disk storage space, but it’s very unlikely that you’d have less with the rest of those <span class="No-Break">hardware specs.</span></li>
				<li>A currently supported web browser is a must-have. That’s what you’ll use to open the web consoles for AWS, Azure, and GCP. It’ll act as your interface with the cloud network that you’re working with. Web browsers are very frequently updated as far as versions are concerned, but any currently supported version of Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Apple Safari, Microsoft Edge, or Opera will do. If your web browser is out of date, your browser will probably remind you to <span class="No-Break">update it.</span></li>
				<li>A currently supported iPhone or Android smartphone is a nice-to-have. You can use it to run Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator to provide an additional factor of authentication for your AWS, Azure, and GCP accounts. The security benchmarks for<a id="_idIndexMarker1091"/> those platforms strongly recommend implementing <strong class="bold">multi-factor authentication</strong> (<strong class="bold">MFA</strong>) on all of your accounts. Here’s <a id="_idIndexMarker1092"/>Google Authenticator for Android: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2</a>.

				<li>GitHub isn’t <a id="_idIndexMarker1095"/>something <a id="_idIndexMarker1096"/>that you need to install, but you’ll find it to be a very<a id="_idIndexMarker1097"/> useful service to open in your web browser in order to install third-party pentesting tools and scripts. Maybe you should keep <a href="https://github.com">github.com</a> in its own web <span class="No-Break">browser tab.</span></li>
				<li>The <a id="_idIndexMarker1098"/>AWS web console at <a href="http://console.aws.amazon.com">console.aws.amazon.com</a>. You’ll <a id="_idIndexMarker1099"/>be logging in to it<a id="_idIndexMarker1100"/> once you set up your own AWS deployment or when you have access to your organization’s <span class="No-Break">AWS network.</span></li>
				<li>The <a id="_idIndexMarker1101"/>Azure web console at <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com">azure.microsoft.com</a>. You’ll be<a id="_idIndexMarker1102"/> logging in to it once you set up your own Azure deployment or when you have access to your organization’s <span class="No-Break">Azure network.</span></li>
				<li>The <a id="_idIndexMarker1103"/>GCP web console at <a href="http://console.cloud.google.com">console.cloud.google.com</a>. You’ll be logging in to it once <a id="_idIndexMarker1104"/>you set up your own GCP deployment or when you have access to your organization’s <span class="No-Break">GCP network.</span></li>
				<li>Prowler (<a href="https://github.com/prowler-cloud/prowler">https://github.com/prowler-cloud/prowler</a>) is one of the most useful pentesting<a id="_idIndexMarker1105"/> tools in this book. You won’t be installing<a id="_idIndexMarker1106"/> it on your own computer; you will install it on your cloud provider’s computer. (The same applies to all of the third-party pentesting <span class="No-Break">tools here.)</span></li>

				<li>Docker <a id="_idIndexMarker1121"/>Desktop (<a href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/">https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/</a>) isn’t essential, but <a id="_idIndexMarker1122"/>it can be useful for you to install on your local computer if you’re pentesting a Docker cluster. It can be installed locally on Windows, Mac, <span class="No-Break">or Linux.</span></li>
				<li>Vishnunair’s automated-pentest (<a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/vishnunair/pentest">https://hub.docker.com/r/vishnunair/pentest</a>) is a Docker container image based on <a id="_idIndexMarker1123"/>Parrot OS that <a id="_idIndexMarker1124"/>can be used to pentest Docker deployments. You’ll actually be installing this in Docker, not directly in your <span class="No-Break">cloud platform!</span></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">kube-bench</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/aquasecurity/kube-bench">https://github.com/aquasecurity/kube-bench</a>) runs vulnerability assessments<a id="_idIndexMarker1125"/> in Kubernetes to make sure they<a id="_idIndexMarker1126"/> comply with the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark, which is a standard for configuring Kubernetes securely.

It’s recommended to run it in Pods instead of on your <span class="No-Break">host machine.</span></li>
				<li>Trivy (<a href="https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy">https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy</a>) is a comprehensive and versatile security<a id="_idIndexMarker1131"/> scanner that can work with both Docker <span class="No-Break">and</span><span class="No-Break"><a id="_idIndexMarker1132"/></span><span class="No-Break"> Kubernetes.</span></li>
				<li>This one last part of your toolkit is absolutely essential but easy to overlook—a reliable internet connection! All of your actions with your cloud networks will need to go through the internet. Hopefully, you have a reliable internet connection at home or in your workplace. If not, an internet cafe or public library will do. But be extra careful to use a VPN if you’re using public Wi-Fi for your work. Using a VPN at home is probably a good <span class="No-Break">idea too.</span></li>

			<p>Next, we’ll look at some cloud- and pentesting-related certifications that you can choose to pursue that may help you acquire cloud <span class="No-Break">pentesting jobs.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-235"><a id="_idTextAnchor235"/>Cloud and pentester certifications</h1>
			<p>There are a number of certifications that may make you more employable as a cloud pentester. Some are from vendors; some are vendor-neutral. Some pertain to cloud networking, and some are general <span class="No-Break">pentesting certifications.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-236"><a id="_idTextAnchor236"/>Cloud</h2>
			<p>Amazon <a id="_idIndexMarker1133"/>offers<a id="_idIndexMarker1134"/> a dozen <a id="_idIndexMarker1135"/>AWS cloud certifications (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/exams/">https://aws.amazon.com/certification/exams/</a>). Here are the ones that are the most useful for <span class="No-Break">cloud pentesters:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>The<a id="_idIndexMarker1136"/> entry-level Foundation certification is Cloud Practitioner (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/">https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/</a>). It covers the basics of cloud computing; no prior experience <span class="No-Break">is required.</span></li>
				<li>SysOps Administrator (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-sysops-admin-associate/">https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-sysops-admin-associate/</a>) is<a id="_idIndexMarker1137"/> the Associate-level certification that I recommend for cloud pentesters. When studying for the exam, you’ll learn <span class="No-Break">the following:</span><ul><li>How to deploy, manage, and operate workloads <span class="No-Break">on AWS</span></li><li>How to implement security controls and meet <span class="No-Break">compliance requirements</span></li><li>The AWS Management Console and the <span class="No-Break">AWS CLI</span></li><li>The AWS Well-Architected Framework and AWS networking and <span class="No-Break">security services</span></li></ul></li>
				<li>Solutions Architect (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-professional/">https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-professional/</a>) is the<a id="_idIndexMarker1138"/> Professional-level certification that I recommend for cloud pentesters. You’ll learn <span class="No-Break">the following:</span><ul><li>How to optimize security <span class="No-Break">in AWS</span></li><li>How to automate <span class="No-Break">manual processes</span></li><li>How to provide complex solutions to <span class="No-Break">complex problems</span></li></ul><p class="list-inset">There are two certifications that I recommend at the AWS Specialty level. That’s the highest level of <span class="No-Break">AWS certification:</span></p><ul><li>Advanced <a id="_idIndexMarker1139"/>Networking (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-advanced-networking-specialty/">https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-advanced-networking-specialty/</a>) can come in handy if you ever become able to develop your own cloud pentesting<a id="_idIndexMarker1140"/> tools! It covers advanced network <span class="No-Break">architecture skills.</span></li><li>Security (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-security-specialty/">https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-security-specialty/</a>) is <a id="_idIndexMarker1141"/>the other AWS Specialty-level certification that I recommend. The certification validates your expertise in creating and implementing security solutions <span class="No-Break">in AWS.</span></li></ul></li>

(This certification also <span class="No-Break">isn’t free.)</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Google, the company that owns and develops GCP, has a few cloud certifications (<a href="https://cloud.google.com/learn/certification#why-get-google-cloud-certified">https://cloud.google.com/learn/certification#why-get-google-cloud-certified</a>) for you to consider, <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Cloud Digital Leader (<a href="https://cloud.google.com/learn/certification/cloud-digital-leader">https://cloud.google.com/learn/certification/cloud-digital-leader</a>) is <a id="_idIndexMarker1151"/>Google’s entry-level cloud certification. It’s the Foundational level of the Google Cloud certification chain. The four<a id="_idIndexMarker1152"/> areas it covers are set <span class="No-Break">out here:</span><ul><li>Digital transformation with <span class="No-Break">Google Cloud</span></li><li>Innovating with data and <span class="No-Break">Google Cloud</span></li><li>Infrastructure and <span class="No-Break">application modernization</span></li><li>Google Cloud security <span class="No-Break">and operations</span></li></ul></li>
				<li>Cloud Engineer (<a href="https://cloud.google.com/learn/certification/cloud-engineer">https://cloud.google.com/learn/certification/cloud-engineer</a>) is the <a id="_idIndexMarker1153"/>next level up. It’s the Associate level of the Google Cloud certification chain. The exam tests your ability to do <span class="No-Break">the following:</span><ul><li>Configure access and security in <span class="No-Break">the cloud</span></li><li>Set up, plan, configure, deploy, and implement <span class="No-Break">cloud solutions</span></li><li>Ensure the successful operation of <span class="No-Break">cloud solutions</span></li></ul><p class="list-inset">There are nine certifications so far at the Professional level of the Google Cloud certification chain, so I’ll just point out the certifications that are more relevant to <span class="No-Break">cloud pentesters:</span></p><ul><li>Cloud Security Engineer (<a href="https://cloud.google.com/learn/certification/cloud-engineer">https://cloud.google.com/learn/certification/cloud-engineer</a>) covers the <span class="No-Break">following</span><span class="No-Break"><a id="_idIndexMarker1154"/></span><span class="No-Break"> areas:</span><ul><li>Configuring access in <span class="No-Break">cloud solutions</span></li><li>Configuring <span class="No-Break">network security</span></li><li><span class="No-Break">Data protection</span></li><li>Managing <span class="No-Break">cloud operations</span></li><li>Ensuring <span class="No-Break">regulatory compliance</span></li></ul></li></ul><p class="list-inset">That’s all very much on the defensive security side, but understanding cyber defense better can make you better at <span class="No-Break">cyber offense!</span></p><ul><li>Cloud Network Engineer (<a href="https://cloud.google.com/learn/certification/cloud-network-engineer">https://cloud.google.com/learn/certification/cloud-network-engineer</a>) gets a bit<a id="_idIndexMarker1155"/> more technical into computer networking. It covers the <span class="No-Break">following areas:</span><ul><li>Network <span class="No-Break">service configuration</span></li><li>Managing, monitoring, and optimizing <span class="No-Break">network operations</span></li><li>Implementing <a id="_idIndexMarker1156"/><span class="No-Break">hybrid interconnectivity</span></li><li>Implementing <strong class="bold">Virtual Private </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Clouds</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> (</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">VPCs</strong></span><span class="No-Break">)</span></li><li>Designing and planning Google <span class="No-Break">Cloud networks</span></li></ul></li><li>One of the <a id="_idIndexMarker1157"/>vendor-neutral cloud certifications that I most strongly recommend is Cloud Security Alliance’s Certificate of Cloud Security Knowledge (CCSK) (<a href="https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/education/ccsk/">https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/education/ccsk/</a>).

			</ul>
			<p>The last cloud<a id="_idIndexMarker1158"/> certification I will recommend is ISC2’s Certified Cloud Security Professional (<span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">CSSP</strong></span><span class="No-Break">) (</span><a href="https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CCSP"><span class="No-Break">https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CCSP</span></a><span class="No-Break">).</span></p>
			<p>The certification shows that you have the technical skills to secure data and applications in the cloud using best practices, policies, <span class="No-Break">and procedures.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-237"><a id="_idTextAnchor237"/>Pentesting</h2>
			<p>Now, here are <a id="_idIndexMarker1159"/>some pentesting certifications that <span class="No-Break">I recommend:</span></p>
			<p>EC-Council’s <strong class="bold">Certified Ethical Hacker</strong> (<strong class="bold">CEH</strong>) (<a href="https://www.eccouncil.org/train-certify/certified-ethical-hacker-ceh-v12/">https://www.eccouncil.org/train-certify/certified-ethical-hacker-ceh-v12/</a>) is a <a id="_idIndexMarker1160"/>certification that you’ll hear about a lot. The learning program for the CEH includes over 200 hands-on pentesting labs, over 500 attack techniques, and many <span class="No-Break">hacking tools.</span></p>
			<p>The other pentesting <a id="_idIndexMarker1161"/>certification you’ll hear about most often is the OSCP, (<a href="https://www.offsec.com/courses/pen-200/">https://www.offsec.com/courses/pen-200/</a>), the OffSec (formerly Offensive Security) Certified Professional. Make sure you have a good understanding of TCP/IP networking, Bash and Python scripting, and Windows and Linux administration experience before you start working toward <span class="No-Break">your OSCP.</span></p>
			<p>Finally, CompTIA’s PenTest+ (<a href="https://www.comptia.org/certifications/pentest">https://www.comptia.org/certifications/pentest</a>) certification<a id="_idIndexMarker1162"/> should not be overlooked. It covers the <span class="No-Break">following areas:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Planning and scoping <span class="No-Break">pentesting engagements</span></li>
				<li>Information gathering and <span class="No-Break">vulnerability scanning</span></li>
				<li>Attacks <span class="No-Break">and exploits</span></li>
				<li>Reporting <span class="No-Break">and communication</span></li>
				<li>Tools and <span class="No-Break">code analysis</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now, let’s look at what you should expect from <span class="No-Break">pentesting contracts.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-238"><a id="_idTextAnchor238"/>Pentesting contracts</h1>
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker1163"/>key difference between a pentest and a real cyber attack is that a pentest is conducted with the full legal consent of the owner of the computer system that <span class="No-Break">you’re pentesting.</span></p>
			<p>Full legal consent shouldn’t be merely a verbal agreement or a “gentleman’s agreement” signed with a handshake. You absolutely must have written legal documentation signed by both a representative of the computer system’s owner and you. Not having signed legal documentation before a pentest is a recipe for disaster because conducting the actions of a pentester without legal consent often constitutes digital crime in most countries around the world. There can be severe legal repercussions both in a civil court <em class="italic">and possibly a criminal court</em>. A signed legal contract is proof of what both parties consented to, whereas verbal agreements and other sorts of informal agreements absolutely will not hold up in court! You want to protect yourself legally, especially if there’s a dispute at some point in <span class="No-Break">the future.</span></p>
			<p>It doesn’t matter whether you’re an employee of the organization you’re pentesting, a third-party contractor, or working in any other circumstances. Nor does it matter whether or not you ever meet the members of your organization offline. Even a simple vulnerability scan without written verifiable mutual consent can get you into a lot of trouble. If you want proper legal advice, I strongly recommend speaking with a lawyer. A qualified lawyer will confirm what I’ve written here, plus may be able to advise you on whether or not the pentesting contract your client or organization presents to you to sign is in your legal best interests. Getting a lawyer to look at your contracts before you sign them is a good idea if you can afford <span class="No-Break">the service.</span></p>
			<p>PentestUSA has an <a id="_idIndexMarker1164"/>example generic pentesting contract (<a href="https://www.pentestusa.com/pdfs/PentestUSAPentestContractTemplate.pdf">https://www.pentestusa.com/pdfs/PentestUSAPentestContractTemplate.pdf</a>) that I encourage you to look at so that you know what <span class="No-Break">to expect.</span></p>
			<p>Cure53 has a<a id="_idIndexMarker1165"/> collection of pentest contract templates (<a href="https://github.com/cure53/Contracts">https://github.com/cure53/Contracts</a>) on GitHub that may be useful <span class="No-Break">for you.</span></p>
			<p>A good pentesting contract worthy of your signature will define the full scope of what you’re expected to pentest. The defined scope may include specified IP addresses, network segments, and domain names. Make sure the defined scope is specific! You should never in any circumstances ever conduct any pentesting activity outside of the scope that’s defined in your contract, even if you think it’s in your organization’s <span class="No-Break">best interests.</span></p>
			<p>You should also<a id="_idIndexMarker1166"/> make sure that your pentesting contract doesn’t expect you to do anything that’s forbidden under Amazon, Microsoft, and Google’s pentesting policies. Feel free to review those policies as often as you need to; they’re listed here. Remember—you’ll be pentesting in Amazon, Microsoft, and Google’s infrastructure, so their rules trump what your organization wants you <span class="No-Break">to do:</span></p>

			<p>Now, let’s take one last look at the product of your pentesting, the <span class="No-Break">pentest report.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-239"><a id="_idTextAnchor239"/>Pentest reports</h1>
			<p>The<a id="_idIndexMarker1167"/> pentest report is the fruit of your pentesting labor. All of that hard work you put in over days or weeks running various vulnerability scans and simulated exploits is all for nothing if you don’t communicate your vulnerability findings to your organization’s defensive security team and corporate leadership in an effective way. They need to have all of the possible information you’ve found about your network’s security posture communicated in a way that’s easy to understand. If your pentest report is effective, then your organization will be able to use your security findings to security harden its network <span class="No-Break">and applications.</span></p>
			<p>Pentest reports <a id="_idIndexMarker1168"/>can be anywhere from just a few pages to over 100 pages; it all depends on how many pentesting exercises and scans you’ve conducted. 50 pages is close to the average based on what I’ve experienced. But don’t set a goal of making your report approximately 50 pages; the length will vary according to how much information you have to share. Your report can be in PDF or Word DOCX format. You should probably have your report available in both formats, just <span class="No-Break">in case.</span></p>
			<p>These are the sections your pentest report <span class="No-Break">should have:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>An <em class="italic">executive summary</em>, at the beginning. It should only be a page or two long. This is <a id="_idIndexMarker1169"/>literally what the executives look at. You should concisely describe the theme of what your pentest found. “The cryptographic keys are stored well, but too many accounts with privileged access lack multi-factor authentication, making those accounts susceptible to cyber attackers.” “Our virtual machines hosted on Azure are fortunately difficult for external attackers to find. But there are way too many exposed services connected to our Google Cloud buckets.” Make sure to mention that if the vulnerabilities you’ve found aren’t mitigated, a successful cyber attack could cost your organization a lot of money. Money is what motivates corporate executives. If the vulnerabilities you’ve found could make your organization susceptible to a data breach, it’s useful to cite monetary figures from IBM’s Cost of a <a id="_idIndexMarker1170"/>Data Breach <span class="No-Break">Report (</span><a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach"><span class="No-Break">https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach</span></a><span class="No-Break">).</span></li>
				<li>In the next section, explain the scope of your pentest and what kinds of vulnerabilities you looked for. You could call this section “<em class="italic">Audit Scope</em>” or “<em class="italic">Penetration </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Test Scope</em></span><span class="No-Break">.”</span></li>
				<li>The<a id="_idIndexMarker1171"/> next section can be called “<em class="italic">Vulnerability Findings</em>.” A lot of the tools in this book will generate scan results with discovered vulnerabilities mentioned according to CVE records and, sometimes, CVSS scores. EPSS ratings are also very important. If you know a vulnerability’s CVE record number but don’t know its CVSS score or EPSS rating, I recommend looking them up from CVEDetails.com (<a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/">https://www.cvedetails.com/</a>). Sort the vulnerabilities in order of EPSS rating, followed by CVSS score. For instance, vulnerabilities with an EPSS rating of 90% should be <a id="_idIndexMarker1172"/>near the top. If more than one vulnerability has an EPSS rating of 90%, mention the vulnerability with the higher CVSS score first. Be sure to include descriptions of each vulnerability from the CVE database, and communicate in your own words how an attacker may be able to exploit <span class="No-Break">the vulnerability.</span></li>
				<li>If you have<a id="_idIndexMarker1173"/> security findings that don’t correspond to CVE records, you can mention them in<a id="_idIndexMarker1174"/> another section titled “<em class="italic">Other Findings</em>” or “<em class="italic">Additional Findings</em>.” Here, you can mention things<a id="_idIndexMarker1175"/> such as “these user accounts lack multi-factor authentication” or “web forms don’t sanitize pop-up window output, possibly giving attackers information they can use to conduct <span class="No-Break">cyber attacks.”</span></li>
				<li>The following<a id="_idIndexMarker1176"/> section can be titled “<em class="italic">Remediation Advice</em>.” You can mention how the vulnerabilities can be patched or otherwise mitigated. The vulnerability findings section should give the defensive security team a clue as to how to triage the vulnerabilities if you follow my guidance and order vulnerabilities from most critical to least critical (based on EPSS and CVSS). But you can still explain here in your own words how you’d advise the defensive security team to prioritize the vulnerabilities. They can’t remediate all the vulnerabilities at the same time, and occasionally a vulnerability can’t be remediated and a security analyst or CISO may need to choose risk acceptance or risk transference (which is usually <span class="No-Break">cybersecurity insurance).</span></li>
				<li>At the end, you<a id="_idIndexMarker1177"/> can<a id="_idIndexMarker1178"/> add a “<em class="italic">Conclusion</em>” or a “<em class="italic">Summary</em>” that, as with the executive summary, generalizes the theme of your findings. But you can use more technical <span class="No-Break">language here.</span></li>
				<li>If you have any references to cite, including things such as CVE records or explanations of exploits that other cybersecurity specialists have written about online; they get listed and hyperlinked at the <span class="No-Break">very end.</span></li>
