    and it could also entail cloud platforms that aren’t covered in this book, such
    as DigitalOcean, Salesforce, IBM Cloud, Oracle Cloud, Rackspace Cloud, and many
    others. A company’s cloud network with any combination of two or more cloud providers
    is a multi-cloud network. Organizations often deploy multi-cloud networks because
    they may want to have functionality or applications that are only provided by
    one cloud platform. For instance, a company may use Microsoft Azure for its native
    Active Directory support for its Windows Server machines on its premises, and
    GCP for its native support for Google Maps and other Google service APIs. AWS,
    Azure, and GCP all have the ability to be integrated with each other in one big
    corporate cloud network.

    own premises. There has been a huge trend of companies all over the world and
    in all industries migrating the functions of their on-premises networks to the
    cloud in the past 10-15 years. But sometimes, organizations find that at least
    some of their network has to stay on their own servers in their own facilities
    for a multitude of reasons. AWS, Azure, and GCP are all able to be integrated
    with a company’s own on-premises network. Hybrid cloud networks may use just one
    cloud platform, or they can also be multi-cloud networks. Pentesting and red teaming
    a multi-cloud hybrid network can be especially challenging for pentesters!

    if your company spends $100,000 USD per month on AWS services, it won’t let you
    inside one of its data centers. The cloud provider is fully responsible for the
    physical security of its data centers. It is also responsible for securing its
    networking infrastructure and all of its physical hardware. If a disk drive physically
    fails, it’s up to the cloud provider to replace it. The cloud provider is also

    acquired from third-party developers) and how much of it is developed by the cloud

    responsibility model applies a bit differently to each type of cloud service.

    platform because they may be disruptive to the cloud provider’s other customers.

    per the AWS *DDoS Simulation Testing Policy* ([https://aws.amazon.com/security/ddos-simulation-testing/](https://aws.amazon.com/security/ddos-simulation-testing/)).
    Some DDoS testing is permitted if the bit volume of the test doesn’t exceed 20
    GB per second. If the packet volume doesn’t exceed 5 million packets per second
    when testing CloudFrunt or 50,000 packets per second when testing other types
    of AWS resources, the DDoS simulation may not originate from another AWS resource,
    and AWS may tell your organization to terminate the simulation testing at any
    time. AWS may make exceptions to these rules *if* your organization applies for
    an exception request *and AWS expressively approves it*! If these criteria are
    too complicated for your red team or pentesters, or if you’re even slightly concerned
    that your DDoS simulation may be forbidden by a cloud provider, just don’t try
    it in the first place. It’s not worth it to risk violating a cloud provider’s
    policies.

    and **IaaS** means **Infrastructure-as-a-Service**. SaaS means that the cloud
    provider has most of the software code and most of the security responsibility—for
    example, Gmail in the Google ecosystem. PaaS means the provider develops a software
    foundation for some of your organization’s own code (or code you acquire from
    a third-party developer). Amazon **Elastic Kubernetes Service** (**EKS**) is an
    example of PaaS. Amazon is responsible for its own Amazon EKS code, but your own
    container images, third-party container images, your containers, and how your
    organization uses your Kubernetes cluster in Amazon EKS is your organization’s
    security responsibility. IaaS is when a cloud provider basically just provides
    the cloud infrastructure. An example of IaaS is Azure VMs, where Microsoft just
    provides the physical servers and the hypervisor for your organization’s VMs.

    internal cyber attacks originate from inside of your company’s network. External
    cyber attacks include the classic kinds of cyber attacks most people think of.
    A bad person hacks into your company’s servers through the internet and deploys
    ransomware. Stuff like that. What’s sometimes forgotten are internal cyber attacks.
    They come from people and entities that already have privileged access from within
    your company’s network. They’re often employees, contractors, executives, or trusted
    supply chain entities. For instance, an employee may suspect that they’re going
    to be fired soon, so they get revenge by breaching your company’s sensitive data
    on a public website. Internal cyber attacks can be easier to conduct and more
    destructive because they don’t have to hack their way into your company’s network;
    they’re already inside because they’re supposed to be there. However, they may
    conduct privilege escalation attacks and lateral movement to access parts of the
    internal network that they’re not allowed to access.

    Those are the properties of data that cyber attacks harm. All cyber attacks impact
    one or more of those three components. Confidentiality is all about making sure
    that data is only accessible to the entities that are permitted access to it.
    For instance, if an attacker could read my email inbox, that’s an attack on my
    confidentiality. Integrity is all about making sure only authorized entities can
    alter data. So, if an attacker used my email to send emails as me, or altered
    the contents of the emails in my inbox or the emails I’m receiving through the
    IMAP protocol, that’s an attack on the integrity of my email. Availability is
    all about making sure that data and data services are usable and accessible when
    they’re supposed to be. If an attacker DDoS attacks my email server and I can’t
    receive or send new emails, that’s an attack on the availability of my email.
    Some attacks impact more than one part of the CIA triad. For instance, enterprise
    ransomware these days often doesn’t just maliciously encrypt data away from its
    rightful owners; it also threatens to breach sensitive data to the public if a
    ransom isn’t paid.

    regardless of its origin. Zero-trust networks exist in contrast with the old traditional
    perimeter security model. In the perimeter security model, there is a security
    perimeter between the internal network and external networks (such as the internet).
    Entities originating from external networks need to be authenticated and authorized
    at the security perimeter in order to be allowed into the internal network, but
    all data traveling around the internal network and all entities originating from
    the internal network is automatically trusted. That security model may have worked
    in the 1990s before cloud computing was a thing, organizations had completely
    on-premises networks, and the cyber threat landscape was less sophisticated. But
    with the advent of the cloud and other 21st-century computing technologies, only
    the zero-trust model is effective for good network security, within the cloud
    and beyond the cloud. Given the way cloud networks operate, only the zero-trust
    model can properly be applied anyway. Plus, it obviously works better for detecting
    and preventing internal cyber attacks as well. In a zero-trust network, your device
    is being authenticated at every possible authentication point.

    changing, so you could have no exposed services today but 20 exposed services
    next week. Some of the pentesting tools I’ve demonstrated in this book, such as

    also the access control methodology that’s native to Kubernetes. In RBAC, users
    are put into user groups based on their roles within the organization, and then
    privileges are assigned to the user groups. For instance, only users in the administrative
    group may be able to create new user accounts, and only users in the payroll group
    have access to the payroll server. Users should only be put into particular user
    groups if they absolutely must have that access for the sake of their jobs; that’s

    accessible database that’s maintained by the MITRE Corporation. **CVE** stands
    for **Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures**. It’s intended to be as comprehensive
    of a database of known security vulnerabilities as possible. There may be a delay
    of a few months between an organization discovering a vulnerability in one of
    its products and it appearing as a record in the CVE database in order to give
    the organization time to patch the vulnerability before it becomes public knowledge,
    accessible to potential attackers. CVE records are numbered with this format—CVE-YYYY-NNNN.
    An example is CVE-2023-1234 ([https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-1234](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-1234)).
    The year (YYYY) indicates when the number was reserved; it may or may not be the
    year the vulnerability was discovered or published in the database. NNNN is just
    a random four-digit number unique to the year, from what I can tell. If the rate
    at which vulnerabilities enter the database increases, they may have to add a
    digit. Published vulnerabilities often have patches available, but not always!
    That’s a scary thought. In my work and for the sake of pragmatism, I generally

    operating systems that can be installed directly onto a computer or used to make
    VMs, except container images are specialized to be used to make containers. Container
    images don’t contain an entire operating system, just the necessary components
    according to how the container is going to be used. Sometimes, organizations will
    create their own custom container images. Container images can be acquired by
    third parties for particular use cases, or you could also use container images
    that AWS, Azure, and GCP provide for you.

    decade work great for your cloud pentesting toolkit. You don’t need to have cutting-edge
    hardware specs because the cloud network’s computing power does most of the work.
    If you need me to be more specific, look for a Windows or Mac PC with at least
    a quadcore 64-bit CPU that’s Intel or AMD x86-64 architecture or Apple M1, and
    with at least 4 GB of RAM. Ethernet and Wi-Fi networking should also be supported
    by your computer’s hardware. Windows 8, 10, or 11, macOS 11 Big Sur or later,
    or any currently supported Debian, Ubuntu, or Fedora Linux operating system work
    great. It’s also nice to have at least 100 GB of internal disk storage space,
    but it’s very unlikely that you’d have less with the rest of those hardware specs.

    in most countries around the world. There can be severe legal repercussions both
    in a civil court *and possibly a criminal court*. A signed legal contract is proof
    of what both parties consented to, whereas verbal agreements and other sorts of
    informal agreements absolutely will not hold up in court! You want to protect
    yourself legally, especially if there’s a dispute at some point in the future.

    a third-party contractor, or working in any other circumstances. Nor does it matter
    whether or not you ever meet the members of your organization offline. Even a
    simple vulnerability scan without written verifiable mutual consent can get you
    into a lot of trouble. If you want proper legal advice, I strongly recommend speaking
    with a lawyer. A qualified lawyer will confirm what I’ve written here, plus may
    be able to advise you on whether or not the pentesting contract your client or
    organization presents to you to sign is in your legal best interests. Getting
    a lawyer to look at your contracts before you sign them is a good idea if you
    can afford the service.

    of what you’re expected to pentest. The defined scope may include specified IP
    addresses, network segments, and domain names. Make sure the defined scope is
    specific! You should never in any circumstances ever conduct any pentesting activity
    outside of the scope that’s defined in your contract, even if you think it’s in
    your organization’s best interests.

    you put in over days or weeks running various vulnerability scans and simulated
    exploits is all for nothing if you don’t communicate your vulnerability findings
    to your organization’s defensive security team and corporate leadership in an
    effective way. They need to have all of the possible information you’ve found
    about your network’s security posture communicated in a way that’s easy to understand.
    If your pentest report is effective, then your organization will be able to use
    your security findings to security harden its network and applications.

- en: Pentest reports can be anywhere from just a few pages to over 100 pages; it
    all depends on how many pentesting exercises and scans you’ve conducted. 50 pages
    is close to the average based on what I’ve experienced. But don’t set a goal of
    making your report approximately 50 pages; the length will vary according to how
    much information you have to share. Your report can be in PDF or Word DOCX format.
    You should probably have your report available in both formats, just in case.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An *executive summary*, at the beginning. It should only be a page or two long.
    This is literally what the executives look at. You should concisely describe the
    theme of what your pentest found. “The cryptographic keys are stored well, but
    too many accounts with privileged access lack multi-factor authentication, making
    those accounts susceptible to cyber attackers.” “Our virtual machines hosted on
    Azure are fortunately difficult for external attackers to find. But there are
    way too many exposed services connected to our Google Cloud buckets.” Make sure
    to mention that if the vulnerabilities you’ve found aren’t mitigated, a successful
    cyber attack could cost your organization a lot of money. Money is what motivates
    corporate executives. If the vulnerabilities you’ve found could make your organization
    susceptible to a data breach, it’s useful to cite monetary figures from IBM’s
    Cost of a Data Breach Report ([https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach](https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach)).

    in this book will generate scan results with discovered vulnerabilities mentioned
    according to CVE records and, sometimes, CVSS scores. EPSS ratings are also very
    important. If you know a vulnerability’s CVE record number but don’t know its
    CVSS score or EPSS rating, I recommend looking them up from CVEDetails.com ([https://www.cvedetails.com/](https://www.cvedetails.com/)).
    Sort the vulnerabilities in order of EPSS rating, followed by CVSS score. For
    instance, vulnerabilities with an EPSS rating of 90% should be near the top. If
    more than one vulnerability has an EPSS rating of 90%, mention the vulnerability
    with the higher CVSS score first. Be sure to include descriptions of each vulnerability
    from the CVE database, and communicate in your own words how an attacker may be
    able to exploit the vulnerability.

    mention them in another section titled “*Other Findings*” or “*Additional Findings*.”
    Here, you can mention things such as “these user accounts lack multi-factor authentication”
    or “web forms don’t sanitize pop-up window output, possibly giving attackers information
    they can use to conduct cyber attacks.”

- en: The following section can be titled “*Remediation Advice*.” You can mention
    how the vulnerabilities can be patched or otherwise mitigated. The vulnerability
    findings section should give the defensive security team a clue as to how to triage
    the vulnerabilities if you follow my guidance and order vulnerabilities from most
    critical to least critical (based on EPSS and CVSS). But you can still explain
    here in your own words how you’d advise the defensive security team to prioritize
    the vulnerabilities. They can’t remediate all the vulnerabilities at the same
    time, and occasionally a vulnerability can’t be remediated and a security analyst
    or CISO may need to choose risk acceptance or risk transference (which is usually
    cybersecurity insurance).
