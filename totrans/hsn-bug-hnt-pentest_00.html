<p class="mce-root">This book is designed to give interested coders (part-time, professional, and otherwise) the skills they need to start participating in public bug bounty programs, covering both general pentesting subjects, such as scoping your testing sessions appropriately, and bounty-specific security topics, such as how to format your bug submission report to ensure the best chance of earning a reward.</p>
<p class="mce-root">As the need for security audits on the public web grows, crowdsourced solutions are becoming more popular. This book aims to give you everything you need to participate in those programs—walking you through important topics with a mix of theory and direct, hands-on examples.</p>

<p>To get the full experience following through the exercises, you should have a basic background in web application development - understanding the general patterns that power the modern web at a high level (for example, server-client, cookies as authentication, HTTP as a stateless protocol) as well as being comfortable with basic web technologies such as HTML/CSS, JavaScript, the browser, TCP/IP, and others. Having some penetration testing experience is helpful, but not strictly required. We also make regular use of the command line in this work, but there are often GUI-related workarounds.</p>
<p class="mce-root">If you have gaps in any of the above topics, I encourage you to still give the book a try. Additional resources, illustrative examples, and links to outside pentesting resources are designed to provide more context if you're stumped on any particular section.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "Mount the downloaded <kbd>WebStorm-10*.dmg</kbd> disk image file as another disk in your system."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>import sys, json<br/>from tabulate import tabulate<br/><br/>data = json.load(sys.stdin)<br/><br/>rows = []</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre>import sys, json<br/>from tabulate import tabulate<br/><br/><strong>data = json.load(sys.stdin)</strong><br/><br/>rows = []</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>docker run -p 8081:8080 -it webgoat/webgoat-8.0 /home/webgoat/start.sh</strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "Select <span class="packt_screen">System info</span> from the <span class="packt_screen">Administration</span> panel.</span><span>"</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>
