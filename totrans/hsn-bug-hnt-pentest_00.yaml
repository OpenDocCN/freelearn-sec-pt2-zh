- en: This book is designed to give interested coders (part-time, professional, and
    otherwise) the skills they need to start participating in public bug bounty programs,
    covering both general pentesting subjects, such as scoping your testing sessions
    appropriately, and bounty-specific security topics, such as how to format your
    bug submission report to ensure the best chance of earning a reward.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As the need for security audits on the public web grows, crowdsourced solutions
    are becoming more popular. This book aims to give you everything you need to participate
    in those programs—walking you through important topics with a mix of theory and
    direct, hands-on examples.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To get the full experience following through the exercises, you should have
    a basic background in web application development - understanding the general
    patterns that power the modern web at a high level (for example, server-client,
    cookies as authentication, HTTP as a stateless protocol) as well as being comfortable
    with basic web technologies such as HTML/CSS, JavaScript, the browser, TCP/IP,
    and others. Having some penetration testing experience is helpful, but not strictly
    required. We also make regular use of the command line in this work, but there
    are often GUI-related workarounds.
  prefs: []

- en: If you have gaps in any of the above topics, I encourage you to still give the
    book a try. Additional resources, illustrative examples, and links to outside
    pentesting resources are designed to provide more context if you're stumped on
    any particular section.
