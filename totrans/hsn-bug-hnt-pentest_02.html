<p class="mce-root">When you're deciding what bug bounty programs you'd like to participate in, it's nice to have a baseline of information about your options <span>– </span>an offering company's report-submission process, submission success rate, the attack surface of the sites in question, and more. Luckily, that information is typically easy to find based on the type of company, its size, the nature of its reward program (third-party marketplace, in-house), and its public statements and documentation.</p>
<p class="mce-root">This chapter will cover how to evaluate marketplaces, programs, and companies and gauge their promise as productive engagements. It will also cover how to zero-in on the areas of web applications where you're most likely to find bugs. At the end of it, you'll know what programs to participate in, why, and how you can make the most of your target application <span>– </span>all while ensuring you color within the lines of your agreed-upon rules of engagement.</p>

<p class="mce-root">Marketplaces are sites that match companies and researchers. They standardize the submission process, rules of engagement disclosure, and other documentation, while providing forums, teaching blogs, and other services to the community. Marketplaces are good sources of technical information and the metrics they typically collect <span>– </span>related to things such as a company's response time and average payout <span>– </span>can help you decide where to direct your efforts. The consistent submission standards mean you can also develop a template <span>–</span> we'll show you an example later <span>–</span> that can be modified and reused between engagements. This allows you to automate tooling around information-gathering, which will make your entire workflow easier and more consistent.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Bugcrowd</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Bugcrowd (<a href="https://www.bugcrowd.com/">https://www.bugcrowd.com/</a>) has a standard sign-up process and doesn't require any proof of experience to become a researcher. You can choose to make your profile public (so people can see the kudos points you've accumulated and general stats about your involvement) or keep it private.</p>
<p>Your page shows your rank, how many points you've accumulated, how many submissions you've made over time, and the accuracy of those submissions. It also displays the average severity of the vulnerabilities you've had rewarded, on a scale of low-moderate-high-critical. Bugcrowd also maintains a system for classifying vulnerabilities, called the <strong>Vulnerability Rating Taxonomy</strong>, in an effort to further bolster transparency and communication, as well as to contribute valuable and actionable content to the bug bounty community. For researchers specifically, the company contends the VRT help[s] program participants save valuable time and effort in their quest to make bounty targets more secure, helping them identify which types of high-value bugs they have overlooked.</p>
<p>Astute researchers will often specialize their skillset to become proficient at detecting a handful of bugs. As you work through the exercises and think about which strategies you'd like to dedicate time to, resources such as the VRT can help you triangulate that perfect intersection of effort and reward.</p>
<p>Bugcrowd uses metrics about your behavior, pulled from the last 90 days, to determine which researchers to invite to private bounty programs. These private programs are opened to a limited set of researchers, who are given a window of time to in which find vulnerabilities. These private programs are great because they mean fewer researchers combing through a particular site, and therefore more chances for you to discover bugs.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>The company also provides a useful service where, every time you log in, Bugcrowd will set aside a relay email address for you at <kbd>[username]@bugcrowdninja.com</kbd> for the next 30 days. Sometimes program guidelines will ask you to create a testing account using this email so the participating company can monitor researchers, but regardless, they're a great resource. Because it's a Gmail service, you can also change the address if you need to spin up multiple accounts (for example, <kbd>[username]+test1@bugcrowdninja.com</kbd> and <kbd>[username]+test2@bugcrowdninja.com</kbd>).</p>
<p>You can find a wide spectrum of businesses on Bugcrowd, covering every size and a variety of revenue models. The targets trend towards web applications, but there is also a smattering of mobile apps and the odd alternative listing.</p>

<p class="mce-root">HackerOne (<a href="https://www.hackerone.com/">https://www.hackerone.com/</a>) is a similar platform <span>– </span>it has its own point system (reputation) and also calculates a variety of metrics that it uses as the basis for its Leaderboard and for invitations to its own private programs.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Like Bugcrowd, it also has a bug bounty policy for itself <span>– </span>if you find a vulnerability in one of its sites or apps, you're entitled to a reward. Interestingly though, you might still be entitled to a reward even if you <em>don't</em> discover a bug. From their site:</p>
<div class="mce-root packt_quote"><br/>
"HackerOne is interested in your research on our systems, regardless of whether you found a security vulnerability. If you have found yourself looking at a particular feature on one of our assets but didn't find anything, please submit a report that describes all the different things you tried and failed. We may reward you for substantial research performed on assets under our bug bounty policy."</div>
<p class="mce-root">This is an usual policy that still makes sense: providing a detailed list of everything that <em>worked</em> is its own audit of the company's resources, even if it doesn't cover any vulnerable areas.</p>
<p class="mce-root">HackerOne and Bugcrowd both have a similar breadth of different companies, with different products, business models, and security needs. HackerOne does have a few notable companies that are exclusive to its platform,<span> </span>most notably Twitter, but generally the offerings are very similar.</p>

<p>Vulnerability lab is a submission-and-disclosure platform that uses a team of in-house experts to vet high-profile vulnerabilities, but also accepts submissions on less critical/lower-profile bugs. One of their site's features actually involves receiving reports for critical vulnerabilities that a researcher might not want to submit directly and acting as a point of contact and third-party broker for the researcher with the affected company.</p>
<p>Like HackerOne, it publicly discloses bug reports after a window of time has elapsed, and is a useful reference for beginners looking to better understand the form of bug reports, and methods for discovering and reporting common vulnerabilities. Their public index of vulnerabilities is also tagged with the type of system each bug was found on, making it a nice resource when you're trying to get a sense of application-specific problems.</p>

<p>BountyFactory, which touts itself as the first European bug bounty platform that relies on European rules and legislation, is run by the larger YesWeH4ck group, an Infosec recruiting company founded in 2013 that's made up of a bug bounty platform, a job board (YesWeH4ck Jobs), a coordinated vulnerability-disclosure platform (ZeroDisclo), and an aggregation of all public bug bounty programs (FireBounty). Like Bugcrowd and HackerOne, BountyFactory has a scoring system, leaderboard, and both public and private programs, for which it extends a limited number of invitations.</p>
<p>Because of its European orientation, BountyFactory is great for finding companies, such as OVH, Orange, and Qwant, that aren't on the popular, American-run alternatives. Many of its clients are straight out of the French start-up scene.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Synack relies on a completely different business model from all the other programs we've discussed.</p>
<p>As a private program that prides itself on its quality and exclusivity, Synack requires more than just an email to become a researcher. The company asks for personal information, requests a video interview, initiates a background and ID check, and conducts a skills assessment to ensure their researchers are capable and responsible enough to audit programs where they might come into contact with sensitive data (one of Synack's specialties).</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Fewer than 10% of applicants to their Red Team are accepted. And unlike the other programs, Synack doesn't publish a leaderboard or any sort of researcher ranking publicly (though they do keep internal rankings as the basis for rewards and invitations to select campaigns).</p>
<p>Intermediaries such as Synack are great if you're looking for more of the private program-type of engagements you're already being invited to on Bugcrowd or HackerOne , where researchers receive exclusive, limited access to the target application. It's also great if you need a quick payout time, or want access to the professional development materials the company only makes available to member researchers.</p>
<p>The fact that Synack keeps its researchers' identities secret is also a benefit, as <span>–</span> though adhering to the <strong>Rules of Engagement</strong> (<strong>ROE</strong>) is always important <span>– </span>it offers the researcher some protection from legal action by companies trying to discourage aggressive auditing, or who interpret their own RoE differently than you do.</p>
<p>In general, Synack is a good option if you've already cut your teeth on bug bounty marketplaces where the cost to join isn't as high, and are looking to make a bigger commitment to security research. If you're willing and able to get passed their screening process, working as part of their red team will secure you less-trafficked targets, exclusive engagements, and quicker payouts.</p>

<p class="mce-root">Company-sponsored programs are just what they sound like. It's not just large mega-corps that have bounty programs <span>– </span>a surprising number of businesses have a process for rewarding security contributions. The size of each company can drastically effect the requirements and conditions for a reward: large companies pay top dollar for vulnerabilities, but the low-hanging fruit of those flaws will already have been picked; start-ups will have less mature applications, but probably a smaller application attack surface, assembled from a newer stack with fewer known vulnerabilities, and might want to pay for contributions in swag. Companies that are mature enough to suffer from technical debt, but also have a budget to pay rewards, are a nice fit. Sometimes, though, you'll just have to poke around in different areas, taking your chances, to find your next vulnerability.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Here are some examples of the programs offered by larger companies.</p>

            <article>
                
<p class="mce-root">Google's program is expansive, with detailed payout structures and specific instructions for classifying different types of bug. Most of the relevant information can be found on the rewards section of their <span class="packt_screen">Application Security</span> page, but Google also curates a (small) set of pentesting tutorials, with specific attention paid to finding the types of bugs and submitting the kinds of reports about them that Google wants to receive.<br/>
<br/>
The articles on Bughunter University and other Google resources have different levels of applicability <span>–</span> some of it is just Google's preferences, requirements, and so on <span>–</span> but even the more idiosyncratic sections contain best practices and wisdom that can applied to other programs and engagements. Other companies might not agree completely with their common types of non-qualifying report, but there'll still be substantial overlap, making it a useful guide regardless of the vendor.</p>
<p class="mce-root">In addition to the materials on Bughunter University, Google is responsible for creating and maintaining a lot of great instructional applications. We'll be using one, Google Gruyere (<a href="https://google-gruyere.appspot.com/">https://google-gruyere.appspot.com/</a>), as part of our chapter on XSS and you can find other great resources from Google in the other tools section at the end of the book.</p>

<p class="mce-root">Facebook has a bug bounty program with a minimum payout of $500, but as the very direct language in their responsible disclosure policy attests, they do not tolerate mucking about with production data: if you comply with the policies when reporting a security issue to Facebook, they will not initiate a lawsuit or law enforcement investigation against you in response to your report.</p>
<p class="mce-root">The amount of information available for their program is minimal. You'll find a side-by-side example of a submission report and an improved version, with some non-qualifying vulnerabilities, but not much in the way of universal lessons or professional tips.</p>
<p class="mce-root">As the legalese signals, Facebook is very sensitive to misuse of its platform <span>–</span> especially given recent increased scrutiny. And because so many exploits will be aimed at affecting users, it's critical to stop short of writing any code that could subvert an account.</p>

<p class="mce-root">Amazon has vulnerability programs for both its e-commerce and cloud services divisions.</p>
<p class="mce-root">An important point is that Amazon requires you to register and ask for permission before conducting any sort of pentesting engagement. This is critical, and a key way the company differs from some of its competitors. Instead of an open-ended participation model where, as long as you abide by the rules of engagement, you can expect immunity, Amazon enforces a permissions-first model to better contain pentesting activity and differentiate White- and Black-Hat activity.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Amazon has a multitude of white papers, blog posts, and documentation on how security works within Amazon, but less material than Facebook or Google to help with penetration testing or bug bounty participation generally.</p>

<p>GitHub offers a bounty program that covers a wide array of its properties, including the API, enterprise app, and main rails site (<a href="https://github.com/">https://github.com/</a>), with payouts ranging from $555 to $20,000 for most of those targets.</p>
<p>One neat feature of the GitHub program is that each participant who successfully submits a bounty receives a profile page that <span>– </span>in addition to showing the points they've accumulated, rank, and earned badges <span>– </span>lists their reported vulnerabilities with a short technical blurb about each one. Like the published submission reports on other platforms, any technical detail about a successfully-discovered vulnerability is an invaluable insight into winning strategies, both in general and for the site in question.</p>
<p>And if you're looking to parlay finding bugs into a larger career in security, profile pages such as the ones offered by GitHub, Bugcrowd, and HackerOne can be great bullet points on your resume.</p>

<p>Microsoft has a rewards program covering both its consumer-software-stable and web-app products, such as their cloud offering, Azure. The Microsoft Bounty Program site goes into detail about submission-report formatting, showing examples of both good and bad specimens, and has detailed, specific testing guidelines for every Microsoft property included. But there isn't a deep reserve of learning material from a general pentesting perspective, and less in the way of community. Microsoft, like many other companies, has its own public leaderboard and ranking system.</p>
<p>Their blog is a good source for more general Infosec analysis. In one series, they provide an in-depth analysis, including source code examples, of Windows exploits used by the Shadow Brokers, the infamous hacking syndicate known to have leaked NSA hacking tools in the summer of 2016.</p>

<p class="mce-root">Many companies have bug bounty programs. If there's a particular site or app you're interested in testing, finding out whether it's supported by a bug bounty is as easy as a couple of searches. Queries that take advantage of Google's expressive search syntax, such as <span><kbd>inurl:/security/</kbd>, <kbd>intext:bug bounty</kbd>, and <kbd>intext:reward</kbd> are all great building blocks you can use to discover new programs. You can even combine them to drill down into bounty programs that are specific to a certain application – a query such as <kbd>intext:"Bug Bounty" AND intext:"vulnerability" AND intext:"reward" AND inurl:"/wp-content/"</kbd>  can be used to return program pages for Wordpress sites (credit to Sachin Wagh (@tiger_tigerboy) for the dorks).</span></p>
<p class="mce-root">You can even set up a Google alert using these search terms and others, to give you a simple, automated way of discovering new programs to participate in.</p>
<p class="mce-root">For something a little less ad-hoc: in addition to the great teaching resources it provides, Bugcrowd curates a list populated by its members on what bug bounty programs are available as well as whether they provide financial compensation versus company swag, their age, and whether or not they feature a "Hall of Fame" for successful researchers. You can find the table at <a href="https://www.bugcrowd.com/bug-bounty-list/">https://www.bugcrowd.com/bug-bounty-list/</a>.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Firebounty, mentioned earlier as a product of YesWeH4ck, is a hybrid <span>that</span> shows that bounty programs from other platforms as well as its own unique offerings. As a product of the French security scene, it has an interesting mix of both transatlantic and European websites, mobile apps, and APIs.</p>

<p class="mce-root">Many of the programs you'll find won't provide a cash payout, but instead company swag (shirts, water bottles, and so on). Don't skip over these programs. In addition to being less-trafficked <span>– </span>upping your chances of finding a bug <span>–</span> and giving you great practice at finding vulnerabilities on a live production site, many swag programs supported by third-party marketplaces will also count toward your profile's chances of being invited to a private program, for those that support them.</p>
<p class="mce-root">These swag-only programs are generally where you should start if you're just beginning your journey. Hacking Google, Facebook, or Amazon will guarantee you a big payout if you succeed, but they already have such large security teams and so many bug report submissions from independent researchers, it'll be hard for someone just starting out to find anything on their first try <span>– </span>much less something that hasn't already been reported.</p>

<p>The internet bug bounty program inhabits something between a third-party marketplace and an individual effort. The IBBP is a not-for-profit funded by big tech contributors such as Microsoft, Adobe, Facebook, and GitHub, for the purpose of protecting the integrity of core internet services. The technologies covered under their reward program are diverse, with languages (Perl, Ruby, PHP), application frameworks (Django, Ruby on Rails), servers (NGINX, Apache HTTP) and cryptographic tools (Open SSL) all covered.</p>
<p>While this work is focused primarily on pentesting web applications as opposed to their more fundamental components, the IBBP is a great resource to keep in mind as your skills advance. The IBBP has been responsible for awarding payouts for some of the most high-profile bugs in the last decade, such as Heartbleed ($15k), ShellShock ($20k), and ImageTragick ($7.5k).</p>

                </header>

<p>If you've discovered a serious, high-profile vulnerability affecting critical services on a large scale, it's important to be aware of certain quirks about coordinated vulnerability disclosures.</p>
<p><strong>Coordinated vulnerability disclosure</strong> is a set of protocols around report submissions that describe a process where the reporter of a vulnerability, the vendor of the component containing the vulnerability, and any third parties (including other companies that use those vulnerable components) come together to coordinate on fixing the issue and disclosing its existence to the general public.</p>
<p>One possible third party in this arrangement is companies such as ZeroDisclo, which we mentioned earlier is also associated with the European company YesWeH4ck (and BountyFactory). Here's an excerpt from ZeroDisclo's website describing their services:</p>
<div class="packt_quote">In constant contact with its community of security researchers, YesWeHack can testify that it is complex for a security researcher and therefore, for a whistle-blower to report security flaws -in a coordinated way–to impacted organizations. Especially, if those organizations do not have a bug bounty program registered on BountyFactory.io<br/>
<br/>
Discoverers of vulnerabilities often experience difficulties on how to report them to the organizations concerned without disclosing them to a third party and unfortunately direct contact with companies constitutes a legal risk.<br/>
<br/>
A long-time partner of the security research community through its founders, YesWeHack is proud to present https://zerodisclo.com/. This non-profit platform provides the technical means and the required environment for all to adopt the coordinated reporting of vulnerabilities commonly known as Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure.</div>
<p>In this case, if a researcher found a serious vulnerability for a core internet service (that is,  JavaScript) but didn't know who to report it to or (more likely) feared legal retribution from an affected company, they could visit ZeroDisclo, either through HTTPS or TOR, and fill out a form describing the nature of their vulnerability and its technical details. Then ZeroDisclo would vet the submission and report it to the affected parties while keeping the original discoverer of the vulnerability anonymous.</p>
<p>If you choose to do this, be careful because you could be breaking program policy. The Internet bug bounty Program, discussed in the preceding section, has a specific question in its FAQs dedicated to using third-party brokers:</p>
<div class="packt_quote">Can I report the bug to you via a third-party broker?<br/>
No. It is unacceptable to share the vulnerability with anyone without the explicit consent of the security team.</div>
<p>Make sure you consider all your options before submitting through a third-party broker. If you decide to use one, take preventative efforts to stay anonymous, such as submitting through TOR, to protect yourself.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">The Vulnerability of Web Applications – What You Should Target</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p class="mce-root">Once you've narrowed down the program you're going to participate in <span>–</span> or maybe you've skipped that and are just plowing through random sites, looking for easy pickings <span>–</span> you can start evaluating individual applications for testing.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Doing so requires an understanding of each application's attack surface. As a quick refresher, Wikipedia sums it up succinctly:</p>
<div class="mce-root packt_quote">The attack surface of a software environment is the sum of the different points (the attack vectors) where an unauthorized user (the attacker) can try to enter data to or extract data from an environment.</div>
<p class="mce-root">We'll get into actual Attack Surface Analysis in the next chapter, preparing for an engagement, but it helps to have a simple idea of it while evaluating different options.</p>
<p>Using that definition of an attack surface and understanding that the larger the attack surface, the more opportunities there are to discover bugs, means we'll want to look for apps that have a lot of entry and exit points for information, ideally ones that are available to anonymous or otherwise not-logged-in users. Social media sites, or blogs and forums that allow anonymous commenters, are all input-rich environments, where the different types of posts, comments, reactions, and so on, provide many different vectors for possibly malicious information to enter the system.</p>
<p>Sites or applications with smaller attack surfaces obviously provide fewer opportunities to find vulnerabilities. A completely static site, where a web server is providing the HTML/CSS markup with no user data input, and no server-side language is interpreting or dynamically creating the site's content, is much more difficult to pentest with the aim of successfully discovering vulnerabilities <span>–</span> there are only so many ways the user can affect the site.</p>
<p>And as discussed briefly earlier in the chapter, web applications – regardless of type – that are protected by large security teams, exposed to large user bases, audited actively by other researchers, or all three, are the least likely to be fruitful hunting grounds. All of these factors combine to create a general portrait of a site's potential: a niche social network with a lot of opportunities for users to interact with the site and each other, created by a small startup, will be an easier target than a static site hosted on an Amazon S3 bucket, where there are no opportunities for user input and the security of the service is managed by a large, dedicated team.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>With the concept of an application's attack surface in mind, some areas make for natural points of interest. OWASP categorizes the different types of attack points to help better model a site's risk:</p>
<ul>
<li>Admin interfaces</li>
<li>Inquiries and search functions</li>
<li>Data-entry (CRUD) forms</li>
<li>Business workflows</li>
<li>Transactional interfaces/APIs</li>
<li>Operational command and monitoring interfaces/APIs</li>
<li>Interfaces with other applications/systems</li>
</ul>
<p>And of course many other actions that allow for user input. These are all opportunities to check for poor data-handling techniques and mishandled sanitization procedures.</p>
<p>As the web becomes more mature, applications become entangled in dependencies and subsidiary services. Those points of contact <span>–</span> APIs <span>–</span> are also great weakpoints to probe in any engagement. A slightly different set of techniques is required than testing through the UI of an application. For example, while testing an application's UI, you might look for an instance of frontend validation that isn't properly enforced by backend services, where you can circumvent the frontend checks or use different encodings to bypass security measures. That technique isn't as applicable to a public API that receives considerable traffic and is designed to be an exposed ingress layer <span>–</span> although it's still susceptible to vulnerabilities, they probably won't be as simple as encoding issues.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Evaluating Rules of Engagement – How to Protect Yourself</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p class="mce-root">It's important before beginning an engagement to closely read the rules of engagement (sometimes also called a code of conduct) to understand the bounds of what is accepted within the program.</p>
<p class="mce-root">The Rules of Engagement lay out:</p>
<ul>
<li class="mce-root"> What techniques are allowed in the source of testing</li>
<li class="mce-root"> What sites/domains/apps are open to pentesting</li>
<li class="mce-root">What parts (if any) of those apps are excluded from testing</li>
<li class="mce-root">What vulnerabilities merit the highest payouts</li>
<li>What vulnerabilities will not receive a payout at all</li>
<li>What credentials/account you should use as a security researcher (for a social network or something with authentication-restricted pages, companies will often offer pentesters a path to creating an account they can use to test user-restricted functionality)</li>
</ul>
<p>The RoE are extremely important not just because they affect your ability to win an award (you don't want to spend time chasing down a bug that doesn't merit a payout), but also because often the company offering the program uses fidelity to the RoE. It's essential to structure your entire pentesting engagement to make sure that it follows the guidelines and, at the end of your research, that you don't get served with a subpoena instead of a paycheck.<br/>
<br/>
One of the most common items in any RoE is a restriction on how scanners are used. Though we'll go into greater detail in <a href="847090b6-8871-4977-9538-17cc1ad52954.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>, <em><span>SQL, Code Injection and Scanners</span></em>, there are principles around using scanners that also apply to your pentest tooling in general.<br/>
<br/>
These principles include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be prepared to avoid using a tool by having an alternate workflow.</li>
<li>Use filters (regex or otherwise), whitelists, and other techniques to tightly control where automation is applied.</li>
<li>Always verify the results of automatic processes manually before submitting them in a report.</li>
<li>Keep verbose logs with timestamps, context info, and so on. They'll make formatting your submission report easier.</li>
<li>Rate-limit scanners or automated tools.</li>
</ul>
<p>While they just seem like general tips, many of these techniques both help you color within the lines of your program's RoE, and <span>–</span> by documenting all the details in the process <span>–</span> give you the material to write a comprehensive submission report at the end of your engagement. Keeping good documentation, limiting the unbounded potential of recursive processes, and overseeing your automated processes are all good habits.</p>

<p class="mce-root">This chapter discussed the criteria you can use to evaluate bug bounty marketplaces, programs, and individual pentesting targets. It covered different types of programs, their distinguishing features, and some of the basics of the bug bounties offered by Amazon, Facebook, Google, GitHub, and Microsoft, along with the learning resources and the general value of third-party bug bounty marketplaces such as Bugcrowd, HackerOne , Vulnerability Lab, BountyFactory, and Synack. It also went over the appeal of swag reward programs, the unique role of the Internet bug bounty Program, the nature of Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure and the risks in using third-party brokers, along with how the Rules of Engagement/code of conduct for different bug bounty programs can differ. Finally, it covered setting up systems and processes within your own pentesting engagements to abide by those rules and protect yourself as much as possible.</p>
