<p class="mce-root">Throughout this book, we've touched on tooling and workflows that have been chosen based on a combination of efficiency, cost, professional opinion, and personal preference. But there are a profusion of security tools that you can leverage beyond the short list we've covered in our walkthrough.</p>
<p class="mce-root">This chapter will cover both how to evaluate adopting new tools, as well as providing a simple overview of other useful Curate software, sites, communities, and educational resources. We'll cover everything from programs, such as scanners and Burp extensions, to crowd-sourced databases of attack snippets, such as SecLists.</p>
<p>The following topics will be covered in this chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Evaluating new tools </li>
<li>Paid versus free editions</li>
<li><span>A quick overview of N</span>ikto, Kali, Burp extensions, and more</li>

<p>This chapter has a grab-bag of technical dependencies depending on what tools you actually want to incorporate into your workflow. Most of our CLI programs can be easily installed with the <kbd>homebrew</kbd> package manager; Burp Suite still requires its Java 8 installation; and, of course, the Kali Linux distribution operates at a different level of the stack, since an OS requires a hard drive partition to install to. As ever, we'll be using Chrome (<kbd>66.0.3359.139</kbd>).</p>

<p>It's critical when you're looking at a new piece of pentesting software to analyze the value it brings to your workflow. It's also critical to ask many of the same questions you'd be asking of an open source, SaaS, or paid app in any other space. Questions should include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What capabilities does this add to my workflow that I don't already possess?</li>
<li>How important are these new features? What do I predict their impact being?</li>
<li>Does this lock me into plans or services or a particular design?</li>
<li>Does it have a mature CLI?</li>
<li>How does it perform against known positive cases (in the case of scanners and other detection software)?</li>
<li>If it's open source, how old is the project? When was the last commit and what's the general frequency of commits? Are there a lot of outstanding issues? Are issues addressed?</li>
<li>In the case of a free tool, is enough functionality exposed to the free/community user? Or is the bulk of what you need locked behind a paid license or subscription?</li>
<li>In the case of a paid tool, does it integrate with an outside workflow (incoming and outgoing webhooks, either client libraries in several languages or a RESTful interface)? Or does it lock you into its system?</li>
</ul>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root">Some of these questions don't have clear answers, but thinking through them will help you understand the value proposition of any software you're considering adopting.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Paid Versus Free Editions – What Makes a Tool Worth It?</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Evaluating whether to start paying for a security tool is just an extension of the process of deciding whether to adopt it in the first place, except with more emphasis on relative impact.</p>
<p>Burp Suite Pro is undeniably a useful extension of the community version. You get the scanner, which integrates tightly with Burp's scoping and attack surface mapping features, and advanced manual tools, such as the ability to generate a CSRF from an intercepted HTTP request (which we'll cover later in this chapter), along with other goodies.</p>
<p>But as we showed in our chapter on CSRF, generating a CSRF PoC is pretty easy to automate yourself, in a way that better integrates with tools outside of Burp. If you don't find yourself needing the other advanced manual tools, then it basically comes down to the scanner. Even if you already have a scanner as part of your workflow though, quite often different scanners are better at scanning different vulnerabilities—you'll get the best picture of a site if you apply multiple scanners to it (which, considering the cost of scanners, is easier said then done).</p>
<p>There's also an extra layer to the value component of Burp. Although you shouldn't purchase a tool with marginal utility just because it's good value, it is an important consideration.</p>
<p>Scanners are expensive. It's not uncommon for the cheapest licenses for top-quality application scanning products to reach into the thousands for a small team (the cheapest offering from Netsparker, a security company, is just under $5,000/year for a desktop app that allows you to scan five websites).</p>
<p>This is clearly an attempt on their part to capture an enterprise security team that wants a reproducible, automated vulnerability detection scheme as part of their general application pipeline/stack. But that phenomenon is common to a lot of the pentesting tool chain, as companies with know-how want to target B2B enterprise opportunities, because that's where the money is. Hackers don't have departmental budgets to throw around.</p>
<p>In that context, the Burp Pro license is a great deal, unlocking more than just scanning functionality for a price that's less than a month of the license subscription of other, popular products. If you've followed along with this walkthrough, or generally use Burp as the lynchpin of your security workflow, you should strongly consider purchasing. If you're spending time inside Burp, it's worth it.</p>
<p>Let's consider another tool, SecApps. SecApps is a browser-based pentesting client created by Websecurify that allows for a completely cloud-based workflow, with no desktop apps, local files, or dependencies beyond the browser required. This is a solution that would fit comfortably into a Chromebook-type setup, where the hardware needs are minimal. There's a lot to recommend SecApps: though they provide some basic free services (such as their HTTP proxy), most of their functionality is on their paid tier (it should be noted that beyond their browser client, they also offer solutions for CI/CD testing), which is still comparatively affordable at $29/month. But even with that low adoption cost, we should still address the same questions we do when considering any new workflow:</p>
<p>Does this lock me into plans or services or a particular design?</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Yes. Moving to an all-cloud workflow takes away a lot of the say you have over your environment. Because your data is all in cloud storage (from a technical perspective), you have no control over it. In addition, none of your workflows can be ported over to another system, considering all your integrations, the interaction of all your tools, and so on, occurs on opaque layers of the stack you can't rely on accessing.</p>
<p>In the case of a paid tool, does it integrate with an outside workflow (incoming and outgoing webhooks, either client libraries in several languages or a RESTful interface)? Or does it lock you into its system?</p>
<p>This is a similar, related question to the general one about vendor lock. The previous question is more about the compatibility of your overall design, and whether that general workflow (and architecture) is portable. This question is more about integrating around the edges. Can parts of your existing workflow be incorporated? If the new tools works great for everything but <em>X</em>, could you still incorporate that in some way? Through a common data format (JSON, YAML, or XML) or a programmatic API interface, could you extend the service's functionality?</p>
<p>The answer for SecApps seems to be sort of. There are some basic CLI options for the more CI/CD solutions, such as their Cohesion app, which is essentially a source code analysis tool DevOps engineers can drop into their build chain. But there's no documentation about using an API to interact with the same backend services the browser-based tooling connects to.</p>
<p>There is a native application wrapper called pown apps, created by Pown.js, but the documentation is pretty spartan and CLI options are limited (see Does it have a mature CLI?), and when we navigate to the Pown.js repository, we don't see much to inspire confidence. Many repositories are new, none have a large contribution graph, and issue/community support seems haphazard (see also If it's open source, how old is the project? When was the last commit and what's the general frequency of commits? Are there a lot of outstanding issues? Are issues addressed?).</p>
<p>That doesn't work for us. As great as the promise of the service is, it's too opinionated about what our pentesting regimen should look like. Contrary to the Unix philosophy of small, single-serving components with specialized concerns and the shared Lingua Franca of plain unicode, SecApps makes us install and use large, complex apps (either through the web or natively via the pown apps bridge) that we don't have visibility into and can't control.<br/>
Other users with different processes around pentesting engagements will naturally have their own opinions about these and other tools, but hopefully us analyzing these tools within the context of this book's workflow will illustrate the key decision points and general process.</p>

<p>There's such a profusion of tools in security that it can be difficult to know what's worth testing for your own workflow. This section includes short descriptions of different types of tools, categorized by the function they serve the pentester.</p>

<p>There are many options for scanners that specialize in gathering or testing a wide range of vulnerability-related information. The few we've used in this work represent just a small portion of the overall market. Here are a few options; some are command line-only while others have both a CLI and a GUI, though all offer at least some degree of CLI control, and all are free.</p>

<p>Most of this book has revolved around testing web applications within the context of their browser-based attack surface—form fields, unsecured endpoints, and things you can generally view within a browser or browser extension.</p>
<p>But if you're looking to do more network analysis—checking for open ports, probing firewalls, and looking for connections beyond the standard HTTP/ TCP—<kbd>nmap</kbd> is a popular weapon of choice and an industry standard.</p>
<p><kbd>python-nmap</kbd> is exactly what it sounds—a Python-based port of the software. This can be extremely useful if you'd like to hack on <kbd>nmap</kbd>. Whether you're adding checks to the existing port discovery of  <kbd>nmap</kbd> or grafting on layers of custom alert logic, the <kbd>python-nmap</kbd> package is a great starting point that frees you from re-implementing the bread-and-butter features of the standard <kbd>nmap</kbd> functionality.</p>

<p>Aircrack-ng is another network scanning tool that's become almost a standard for Wi-Fi cracking and packet capture. As before, though we didn't cover general network analysis that much in this book, there's a great suite of tools for anyone looking to get started.</p>
<p>And critically, unlike something such as social engineering, which is an element of pentesting we specifically did not cover since it's so often out-of-bounds for most programs, companies will reward researchers for pointing out holes in their network.</p>

<p>Continuing with network scanners, Wireshark is another battle-tested network analysis program, with deep packet inspection and other low-level data capture functionality that can be crucial for understanding an app's cryptographic security posture. If you develop a greater emphasis on network-level security issues, Wireshark should be on your radar, if not a part of your toolset.</p>

<p>SpiderFoot (<a href="http://www.spiderfoot.net/">http://www.spiderfoot.net/</a>) is a scanner that specializes in <strong>Open Source Intelligence</strong> (<span><strong>OSINT</strong>)</span>, combing through social media networks, DNS records, and other publicly available information to assemble a picture of the target application's attack surface and possible vulnerabilities.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Although undeniably useful, in this book, I've chosen to focus more on scanners that interact directly with the application property at hand. SpiderFoot is wonderful for the kind of in-depth research that goes into preparing social engineering attacks, such as getting emails and position titles, and understanding the relationships between key corporate players. It's also great for finding related, dependent systems that could be compromised as a way of ultimately infiltrating an organization.</p>
<p>Fortunately (or unfortunately) for us, those types of attacks are out of scope for most pentesting engagements. Social engineering attacks and attacking vendors/third parties are almost always called out in a testing guideline's rules of engagement as forbidden behavior. It's a cool scanner and useful tool, just not for our purposes.</p>

<p>Kali (formerly BackTrack) is a security-focused Linux distribution that comes pre-packaged with a lot of the tools we've been using throughout the book, such as Burp Suite, as well as others, such as Maltego, Metasploit, and Wireshark.</p>
<p>And because you can boot and run Kali from a live CD, it's potentially very lightweight. There's no need to do a persistent install on hardware and no need to write any data to disk. These two features of Kali (it's portability and preloaded assets), make it a great choice for pentesters who might not have regular access to their own machine.</p>

<p>Source code analysis is typically outside the scope of a public bug bounty program (which is why is doesn't get more coverage in this book). Companies are naturally hesitant to open source their code to a body of security researchers if open source isn't a part of their business model.</p>
<p>But if you find yourself in a private contract where you engage in white box testing with access to source code, or you have access to the code through GitHub or Bitbucket, there are several tools you can use to help identify problem areas.</p>

<p>Bandit is another great source code analysis tool that analyzes Python using a series of customizable plugins that can be used to focus the tool on a specific set of vulnerabilities. Unlike <kbd>pytaint</kbd>, Bandit doesn't follow a particular methodology like taint analysis; rather, the logic applied depends on your plugin integrations.</p>

<p>Brakeman (<a href="https://brakemanscanner.org/">https://brakemanscanner.org/</a>) is considered one of the top security static analysis tools for Rails apps, and is used by industry leaders such as GitHub to secure their internal RoR stack. If you have access to the source code, Brakeman is an excellent tool for discovering Rails-based issues.</p>

<p>There are many ways to expand on the Burp Suite workflows we've covered in this book. Some of the extra solutions will be paid features, to show the appeal of considering a subscription, and others will simply be other extensions or features we didn't have time to take advantage of in the course of our engagements.</p>

<p>An easy add, the JSON beautifier pretty-prints any JSON you interact with within Burp Suite. It's simple, but formatting can be a big productivity boost if there are portions of your process that have a lot of manual interaction. There's also a similar set of beautifiers/pretty-printers for other languages, including YML, JS, SAML, and more other common data types.</p>

If Burp is a large part of your workflow, it might be worth considering.</p>

<p>The Python scripter extensions execute Python code on every Burp HTTP request. This can make it much easier to graft on extra functionality than if you are trying to add Java code or your own extension directly.</p>

<p>The Burp REST API plugin (<a href="https://github.com/vmware/burp-rest-api">https://github.com/vmware/burp-rest-api</a>) allows you to run your Burp instance within a wrapper that makes its chief functionality available through a RESTful API. This is obviously a great addition if you're looking to integrate Burp with your existing automation.</p>

<p>The aforementioned extensions are mostly just standalone additions to the existing Burp workflow. But Burp also supports extensions that act as bridges to other security toolsets. Faraday (<a href="https://www.faradaysec.com/">https://www.faradaysec.com/</a>) describes itself as a multi-user, collaborative pentesting environment that a security team can use to share scope, target data, discoveries, and other engagement information. There's also tool-specific bridges, such as SQLiPy, which is an extension for kicking off <kbd>sqlmap</kbd> scans from within Burp.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Using Burp Pro to Generate a CSRF PoC</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>A great method for testing for CSRF and generating a code PoC for a CSRF vulnerability is using some of the built-in tooling available. Unfortunately, the ability to generate a CSRF PoC is only available for Burp Suite Pro users.</p>
<p>For our test, we're going to revisit a page on <kbd>webscantest.com</kbd> that we examined in <a href="ddd8275b-fae6-423c-b7a0-e8284a77a648.xhtml"/><a href="ddd8275b-fae6-423c-b7a0-e8284a77a648.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>, <em><span>Unsanitized Data – An XSS Case Study</span></em>, for XSS vulnerabilities that's also vulnerable to CSRF attacks.</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/02975992-f5d6-4360-bbee-263dd91c8d01.png" style=""/></div>
<p>After navigating to the form, let's fill out the different field values:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/a8bd4468-3137-46e0-8ce7-89716290bce4.png" style=""/></div>
<p>Before submitting the form, we'll turn Burp proxy's <span class="packt_screen">Intercept</span> feature on so we can capture our request:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/f4d48740-dd66-45ad-a06f-56de8859b315.png" style=""/></div>
<p>After submitting our form, we can see the request has been successfully intercepted by Burp Proxy:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/74e63a06-9e59-4d04-a465-360e3e3dc1ff.png" style=""/></div>
<p>Now if you right-click on the intercepted request in Burp Proxy, you can see in the dropdown the engagement tools submenu. If you're a free/community user, these options will be disabled, but if you're a paid/Pro user, you can select <span class="packt_screen">Generate CSRF PoC</span>.</p>
<p>You can use this CSRF PoC, which is really just a short HTML snippet that reflects the form and submission structure of whatever you're testing, to trigger the application state changes that will prove the presence of a CSRF vulnerability (so, a PoC). If you have access to this functionality, it can be a quick and easy method, but if you don't, it's also easy to replace (we generated a CSRF PoC programmatically in <a href="c685f58d-e796-4729-8766-9338c92682e2.xhtml"/><a href="c685f58d-e796-4729-8766-9338c92682e2.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>, <em><span>CSRF and Insecure Session Authentication</span></em>).</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Metasploit is a popular exploitation framework provided by Rapid7 that, although it features a stable of common scanning and proxy features, really shines in the post-discovery, exploit-writing phase, when the bug has been found and you're trying to use it as the foothold for a larger attack.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>That's the reason we haven't covered the tool much. Because Metasploit's real value is taking (for example) an SQLi vulnerability and turning it into an attack that exploits that bug to expose user data, change the attacker's privileges, or accomplish some other malicious end, it doesn't fall within our bounty-oriented workflow, which is more concerned with the bug itself. In fact, most bug bounty programs actively discourage taking that next step. It's essentially what separates a white hat researcher from a black hat hacker.</p>
<p>However, Metasploit <em>can</em> be a great tool for brainstorming realistic, stomach-churning attack scenarios that can convince a security team that the vulnerability you're submitting is a real threat. Clearly and convincingly articulating the impact of your findings is the most direct path to bigger payouts and higher submission success rates.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we've covered tools and methodologies beyond those we used directly in our walkthroughs. We've also discussed a process for evaluating new tools, and an example applying that analysis to Burp Suite Pro and SecApps within the context of the pentesting engagements we've explored throughout the book. By now, you've seen an expanded overview of different types of scanners (application, network, and OSINT), community databases of attack patterns, source code analysis tools, new Burp extensions and workflows, the value of exploitation frameworks, and more. This should broaden your horizon of understanding beyond this book and provide the basis for your continued development as a security researcher.</p>
