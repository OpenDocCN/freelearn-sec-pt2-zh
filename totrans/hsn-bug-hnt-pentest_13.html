<p class="mce-root">Hopefully, you've found the resources contained in this book useful. As you look to expand your interest in infosec, vulnerabilities, and public bug bounty programs in particular, there are plenty of great resources to help you on your way.</p>
<p class="mce-root">In this chapter, I've tried to collect a smattering of some of the best community sites, curated blogs, educational resources, bug report archives, and finally, a glossary of some of the more important (and opaque) security terms used by this and other books. This chapter should be a nice reference going forward, acting as your springboard as you dive deeper into the world of independent, freelance security research.</p>

<p class="mce-root">Blogs, both company-authored and personal, are great ways to get keyed into new resources and methods from an informed source who you trust to curate the news you care about. The blogs we're including here focus more on pentesting and bug bounty participation than infosec or cybersecurity, generally. Though there are a lot of great blogs by industry experts —such as Bruce Schneier's <em>Schneier on Security</em> or Brian Krebs' <em>Krebs on Security</em> —that can be counted upon for rigorous, technically-informed articles on popular security topics, providing a thorough accounting of those sort of general infosec outlets is beyond our scope.</p>

OSCP is respected because it enforces a practical lab where, instead of answering multiple choice questions, the test taker must log on to the OSCP network and discover several vulnerabilities within their allotted 24-hour testing period. Though you might want to work your way up to the OSCP exam (and it can be expensive), it's a great goal if you're interested in pursuing a career in security.</p>

Keep in mind that this dictionary is only for security-related terminology, and not general web or software development jargon, except where it has direct bearing on a security issue.</p>

<p class="mce-root">An application's attack surface is the sum of all of the points in which data is either inserted into or taken out of the application. Each part of the attack surface is an opportunity for a hacker to compromise a part of your application. The larger your app's attack surface, the more work you have to do to secure your app, and the more difficult it will be. Keeping your attack surface no larger than it absolutely needs to be is a great way to strengthen your security posture.</p>

It's important to note here that the usage of "bug" does not include functional UX/UI bugs (for example, a modal opens and closes before you can fill out a form, a CSS artifact keeps you from reading an explanatory tooltip, the text color is too light to be read, and so on). We mean bug only in the sense that the term is used in the security/pentesting community.</p>

<p class="mce-root">This book focuses on public or near-public programs that reward researchers for contributing valid vulnerability discoveries to the company or companies behind the program. Sometimes that reward comes in a gamified point system (Bugcrowd's kudos) swag, recognition (often on a wall of fame-type display), money, or some combination of these. The term near-public refers to private bounty programs where invitations to test the application are awarded to researchers on the basis of past performance, average severity of vulnerabilities discovered, and other career stats. This definition of bug bounty programs leaves out situations where an individual or team of pentesters signs an exclusive contract for their services. In that case, many of the techniques we discuss will still carry over, but the format and nature of the reports would differ.</p>

<p class="mce-root">Data leakage, unlike data exfiltration, implies that improperly configured services or other systems are exposing sensitive data by accident. This meaning comes more from the shading of the term than any formal definition, but provides a useful descriptor when the vulnerability in question is something like an unsecured logging server that's open to the public internet, and displays authentication credentials in the logs by accident. In that scenario, no one has hacked into the application, or compromised the network or database, but someone has made the mistake of leaving that resource open, and that data could provide the basis for another wave of attacks.</p>

<p class="mce-root">An exploit is the malicious code that powers an attack on an application or its users, leveraging the flaw presented by a vulnerability to take advantage of weak/broken authentication, poor privilege management, insufficient data control, or other vectors to make mischief. Software billing itself as an exploit framework, such as Metasploit (which we discuss in our <a href="ed465f46-31a7-429c-b0d2-6616dace7167.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>, <em>Other Tools</em>) is designed to help write malicious exploit code. Because our focus in this work is on discovering vulnerabilities rather than exploiting them, exploits come up most frequently within the context of writing a credible, generally-scary attack scenario for your submission report.</p>

Detecting the hosting service, server OS type (if that's the backend) and version, the application language and framework, any included third-party libraries, and publicly-viewable API integrations, is all an essential part of the discovery process.</p>

We talk about component vulnerabilities in the <a href="dae37ac2-dba8-48d5-a08a-0d29d0dc9030.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>,<a href="dae37ac2-dba8-48d5-a08a-0d29d0dc9030.xhtml"/> <em>Framework and Application-Specific Vulnerabilities</em>.</p>

<p class="mce-root">Open source intelligence is the practice of collecting information about a target from public records (domain registrar records, official documents, social network profiles, participation in public forums or other digital spaces, and other sources) that can be used to assist in other intelligence-gathering activities, such as compromising passwords or enabling targeted social engineering (spear phishing, whaling, and so on).</p>

<p class="mce-root">Passive scans analyze data flow within web applications. They are much less noisy, having little or no effect on the logs and associated metrics that provide an app's maintainers with information. By contrast, active scanning involves sending data into the application and then analyzing the response. Active scanning is often prohibited, because of the damage it can do to a network and the ways it can degrade application performance.</p>

<p class="mce-root">In general software development, a payload is essentially the message of an action<span>—</span>the semantic content an action contains beyond its metadata, headers, and other system information. In a cybersecurity context, a payload is similarly the weaponized, malicious code snippet value of an input that escapes sanitation measures and actually executes the attack.</p>

<p class="mce-root">RCE is a three-letter acronym to make anyone quake. Remote code execution is exactly what it sounds like. It triggers the execution of an arbitrary code snippet on a remote machine through a network (for example, the internet). A vulnerability that allows for RCE is a highly-critical issue that will ensure you get a nice payout. The possibilities afforded by having that sort of access to a service are vast: adding the machine to a botnet, exfiltrating data, draining the victim's resources with cryptocurrency mining. Considering the open-ended possibilities of a Turing complete language, an imaginative attacker can do an impressive amount of damage.</p>

<p class="mce-root">An engagement's scope refers to both the areas of the target application that can be subjected to analysis (as defined by IP addresses, hostnames, and functionality) as well as the type of testing behavior not allowed (for example, active scanning disallowed, don't mess with or modify another user's data, and so on). Adhering to scope is critical, both out of respect to the program's operators and to minimize any liability you might incur by touching out-of-bounds systems.</p>

<p class="mce-root">Workflow is a catch-all term used throughout the book to reference both the formal and informal processes built into conducting a thorough security audit of a new site. An example of a formal process might be a list of different types of vulnerabilities you'd like to ensure you check for in any application, or even just a general outline of the different phases of your engagement, from discovery to wrap-up and reporting. An informal process example would be the internal heuristics you use to decide whether applying a tool in a given situation is worth it.</p>
