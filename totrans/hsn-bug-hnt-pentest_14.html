<li class="mce-root">A growing number of companies are crowdsourcing their security audits—both to cut costs internally and benefit from the greater variety of researchers, strategies, and technologies.</li>
<li class="mce-root">Participating in bug bounty programs gives you valuable, practical security experience against real production targets. It also earns you money.</li>
<li class="mce-root">You'll need some basic web tech skills, but also a general curiosity and investigative desire to break things.</li>
<li class="mce-root">Some tool, such as Burp Suite, are workhorses that integrate multiple functions (proxying, scanning, mapping) for maximum effect, while some are for a more specific outcome (<kbd>sqpmap</kbd> for SQLi discovery, <kbd>wfuzz</kbd> for Brute Force file discovery, and so on) along with the single-purpose, one-off scripts that we assemble to add extra features or glue together workflows.</li>
<li class="mce-root">Adding <kbd>document.location.origin</kbd> can ensure that we are targeting an in-scope domain. This information also gives us a valuable insight to the developers patching the bug.</li>
<li class="mce-root"> Considering the impact of a vulnerability is essential to writing a compelling attack scenario. Writing code to actually harm the application, a user, or a third-party service is absolutely out of bounds, even if done to prove the exploit.</li>
<li class="mce-root">The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act governs domestic cybersecurity law as an extension of the earlier computer fraud law. The bill was passed in no small part to the sobering effect of the 1983 hit starring Matthew Broderick, <em>Wargames</em>, which the House Committee report on the law described as "a realistic representation of the automatic dialing and access capabilities of the personal computer."</li>

<li>Yes! In addition to giving you valuable experience, it can open the doors to private programs that offer better testing opportunities.</li>
<li>We use this term to refer to private bounty programs on platforms like Bugcrowd where invites are only extended to a pre-selected, screened number of researchers who meet certain criteria.</li>
<li>You can find more resources in the <em>Other tools</em> and <em>Going further</em> sections.</li>
<li>An older site with more opportunities for user inputs, using software that is not updated regularly, and maintained by a small organization will find it naturally harder to secure their attack surface than a large company with a smaller attack surface and an internal security team.</li>
<li>Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure is a process and set of standards for disclosing a vulnerability to a company through a third party.</li>

<li><kbd>wfuzz</kbd>, paired with a comprehensive wordlist represents a powerful brute force mapping tool—<span>o</span>ne that's effective, but should be used only when brute forcing is appropriate.</li>
<li>Site maps are a simple, free shortcut to basic reconnaissance. If one doesn't exist, you can use Burp Spider to map the target application.</li>
<li>If you're looking for a lower-impact alternative for mapping an attack surface, you can navigate the target application with the browser connected to your Burp Proxy and Burp will automatically build a sitemap.</li>
<li>Scrapy is a great, extensible solution for scraping sites.</li>
<li>Writing short, single purpose scripts allows you to mix and match functionality, with a common foundation of text ensuring interoperability.</li>

<li>Stored/Persistent, Reflected, and DOM Based XSS are three common varieties of XSS.</li>
<li>Persistent XSS is particularly dangerous because the malicious code stored in the server can be served up to a large number of users.</li>
<li>There are a lot of false positives associated with XSS discovery. XSS Validator helps boost the signal through the noise.</li>
<li>The XSS Validator <kbd>phantomjs</kbd> server listens for possible vulnerabilities and performs validation checks on them.</li>
<li>Use the <strong><span class="packt_screen">Payload Positions</span></strong> feature in the <span class="packt_screen">Payloads</span> tab in Burp Intruder.</li>
<li>All of the usual contextual data is important (URL location, input, and so on), but the payload is most essential.</li>
<li>An XSS vulnerability could allow an attacker to steal admin account credentials and take the actions of a superuser for a particular service and organization.</li>
<li>Including an attack scenario convinces the team receiving the report that they should expend the necessary resources to fix the bug (and trigger your reward).</li>

<li>CSRF stands for Cross Site Request Forgery and is when an attacker takes advantage of a logged-in user's authenticated state to execute malicious application requests and change the user's app in harmful ways.</li>
<li>An attacker with access to a CSRF vulnerability can trick a user into changing application state against their will, or in a way they don't intend to (for example, routing money to a different bank account).</li>
<li>A CSRF PoC is just the bare-bones markup necessary to recreate the form's HTTP request.</li>
<li>If you can open a CSRF PoC in your browser and submit it successfully, that validates the vulnerability.</li>
<li>Using BeautifulSoup to generate HTML lets you allow tedious string manipulation (for example, splitting and inserting nested tags).</li>
<li>We used a CSRF POST-based attack in our E2E example.</li>
<li>A malicious actor would use more hidden fields, and allow his/her victim to control less of the data sent to the server.</li>

<li>XXE vulnerabilities can allow for an attacker to expose sensitive files on the server, DoS the application, or sometimes get RCE.</li>

<li>Security through/by obscurity is a valid way of discouraging opportunistic attacks, but it cannot be the foundation of a sound security strategy.</li>
<li>API keys, access tokens, passwords, and account and application data are all commonly reported for bounties.</li>
<li>The Burp Proxy contains settings for passively uncovering hidden fields—a simple hack.</li>
<li>An API key grants blanket access to an API or service. An access token is typically associated with more individual/role-based authentication systems, though this is not a hard and fast distinction.</li>
<li>Generic error codes and descriptions, browser "autocomplete" functionality, and information that generally doesn't provide an associated attack scenario, does not typically merit a reward.</li>
<li>It is always a mistake to trust user input.</li>
<li>Web applications are leaky, but error messages, hidden fields, and client-source code are all areas where sensitive information lurks.</li>

<li>OSINT stands for Open Source Intelligence and is the process of gathering information about a target from publicly available sources, like social media profiles and public record data.</li>
<li>Metasploit bills itself as an exploitation framework and is designed to both detect and generate the code to exploit vulnerabilities. As a tool that shines in the exploitation phase, we don't touch on it much in this book.</li>
