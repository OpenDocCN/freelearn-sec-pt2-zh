- en: This book is intended for anyone who wants to learn how to perform hacking/penetration
    testing. It is designed to start from scratch, assuming no prior knowledge, and
    takes you all the way to a strong intermediate level in the subject. The book
    is highly practical but it will not neglect the theory. It starts with some basic
    terminology; then you'll learn how to set up a penetration-testing lab and install
    all the necessary software. The remainder of the book is divided into a number
    of sections, each covering a penetration testing field—from networks, servers,
    and websites to client-side attacks and social engineering. In each of these sections,
    you'll learn how a target system works, the weaknesses in the system, how to exploit
    those weaknesses and hack the system, and how to secure the system from the discussed
    weaknesses. By the end of the book, you'll have a strong base and a good understanding
    of hacking/penetration testing, so you'll be able to combine the techniques shown
    and tailor them to suit different scenarios.

- en: This book starts from scratch, assuming the reader has no prior knowledge of
    hacking/penetration testing. Therefore, it is for anybody who is interested in
    learning how to hack or test the security of systems like real hackers and secure
    them like security experts.

- en: '[Chapter 2](a5f6fe8b-4e96-47b3-937e-9179b9e9a5d5.xhtml), *Setting Up a Lab,*
    looks at setting up a lab and installing all the software that is needed in order
    to get started with penetration testing. We are going to discuss this because,
    all through this book, we are going to learn about launching attacks on our system
    by creating a virtual environment in it.'

    you through the Kali Linux environment so that you become familiar with the virtual
    framework. We will be learning some basic commands, as well as looking at the
    installation and updating of software.'

    Testing*, will cover the basics of what we mean by a network and will examine
    the various types of network. Also, we will discuss a few terminologies related
    to networks.'

    will discuss wireless cards. Then we will learn how to gather information about
    networks and computers, and we''ll learn how to launch attacks, such as controlling
    connections without having the credentials of the target. We will learn how to
    capture information about victims by creating fake access points to which the
    targets will be connected.'

    Testing – Gaining Access*, demonstrates how we can crack the key and gain access
    to our target by using all the information that we have gathered about the victim.

    will teach you how to gather information about the network so that we can use
    it to perform further powerful attacks. To do so, we will be using various tools.
    Each of those tools has various advantages that we can exploit to find out more
    useful information about the victims.'

    Attacks*, will be about launching various man-in-the-middle attacks, such as ARP
    spoofing, session hijacking, and DNS spoofing. We will also learn about the Wireshark
    tool, which is incredibly effective for analyzing the packets flowing in and out
    of the victim''s system.'

    to perform the attack, how to detect it, and also how to prevent and secure our
    systems from this attack. We will also be learning about how Wireshark can help
    us with all those endeavors.'

    Computer Devices*, teaches us how to gain full control over any computer system.
    This chapter will cover the first approach, which is server-side attacks. In this
    chapter, we will learn how to gain full access to the target system without user
    intervention. We will even be gathering information about the operating system
    of the victim, as well as any open ports and installed services that might help
    us identify the weaknesses and vulnerabilities of that system. Then we will be
    exploiting the vulnerabilities to control the target.'

    system. Here, we will be making use of packets that move in and out of the target
    system to launch attacks. To track packets, we will learn about a tool called
    Veil, which even helps us generate backdoors. We''ll also look at securing our

    are not apparent. In such cases, our only solution is interacting with the user,
    and that is where social engineering comes into play. We will be using various
    techniques to get the victim to install a backdoor to their device. To achieve
    this, we will be creating fake updates and backdooring downloaded files on the
