    be covered throughout this book. It will cover all of the aspects associated with
    hacking, from how to perform hacking to protecting your system from being hacked.
    Later in the chapter, we will discuss the concept of hacking, discussing three
    types of hackers: white hat hackers, black hat hackers, and grey hat hackers.
    Toward the end of the chapter, we will illustrate some real-time hacking applications.'

    by setting up a fake access point and luring people into connecting to networks
    so that we can capture data that is sent or received through them. We will then
    learn how to get the password for any Wi-Fi network, whether it uses WEP, WPA,
    or WPA2 encryption.

    gain access to any account that is accessed from any computer in a network. We

    on a network send or receive.

    to do). For example, you can view information that you don't have permission to
    see or use a computer that you're not allowed to use. There are many different
    types of hacking, such as email hacking, computer hacking, server hacking, and
    web application hacking.

    use the same methods as black hat hackers, but they only do it on systems for
    which they have permission to do so, in order to see if the systems are vulnerable—they
    hack them in order to fix them.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Grey hat hackers**: There are also grey hat hackers, which are a mix of both;
    they will test any systems that they want to test, even if they don''t have permission
    to hack them. Once they do hack into things, they don''t break anything or steal
    any money; they don''t cause damage. They might even tell the administrators how
    to fix it.'

    hacking for educational purposes. It is for people who want to be able to secure
    their networks, and who want to work as pen testers to secure computer systems.

    is happening every day, and it involves a growing demand for protection. We all
    heard about the Sony hack when PlayStation was down for a considerable amount
    of time. Companies such as Sony are actually hiring people to try to hack into
    them. You're going to learn how to hack into networks and systems so that you
    can secure them from black hat hackers.

    for Facebook on its mobile website, because Facebook didn't check for the number of
    times that you entered the incorrect PIN. Once the person had done this, they
    told Facebook about it, and they were rewarded with $20,000, because Facebook
    has a bug bounty program. At the moment, many websites and companies have bug
    bounties – they are asking people to try to hack them, and they will pay a certain
    amount of money if a hack is successful, depending on how dangerous the exploit
    is.

    Right now, all we need to understand is that this program is going to inject the
