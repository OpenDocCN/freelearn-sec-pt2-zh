- en: VirtualBox is a program that will allow us to install machines, just like normal
    computers, inside our own machine. We will have one computer, and we will install
    other computers inside it, acting as virtual machines. These are very important
    in terms of penetration testing; we're going to be using them a lot in order to
    set up a lab. It's very important to note that a virtual machine is just like
    a completely separate, working machine; there is nothing we will lose by installing
    an operating system as a virtual machine, and it will perform just like it does
    when installed on a separate laptop. Basically, instead of having four or five
    computers or laptops around us (so that we can try to hack into them), we're going
    to install them as virtual machines inside our own machine. This might seem a
    bit vague now, but once we get further into the chapter, the concept of how VirtualBox
    works will become clearer.

    system designed for hacking. We're going to use an operating system called Kali
    Linux, a flavor of Linux based on Debian. It comes with all of the programs and

    it will show how to create a NAT Network. This setting is basically going to create
    a virtual network that our host machine will be the router for, and then all of
    the virtual machines are going to be clients connected to this network. So, they're
    going to get internet connection from the host machine and, at the same time,
    all of my virtual machines will be connected to a virtual network. This is very
    handy, because my virtual machines will be able to communicate with each other;
    we can use one of them to hack into another, and we can use it to test network
    attacks, and much more.

    update the system, there is a good chance that some programs will not be as up
