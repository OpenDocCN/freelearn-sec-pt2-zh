<p>Now that we have Kali Linux installed, let me provide you with an overview of the system: what Linux is, the <span>filesystems </span>structure, and some of the basic apps that we are going to use. We will see an overview of the system now, and later, we will walk through some commands, which we will see in more detail in later chapters.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Status bar icons</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>As you can see, in the following screenshot, there is a status bar at the top, and toward the end (on the left-hand side of the <span class="packt_screen">Applications</span> menu), there is an <span class="packt_screen">Applications</span> tab to access all of the applications that come preinstalled with Kali Linux. These are divided into categories, in terms of the type of attack that they allow you to carry out. We can see the following: <span class="packt_screen">01 – Information Gathering</span>, <span class="packt_screen">02 – Vulnerability Analysis</span>, <span class="packt_screen">03 – Web Applications Analysis</span>, <span class="packt_screen">04 – Databases Assessment</span>, <span class="packt_screen">08 – Exploitation Tools</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">07 – Reverse Engineering</span>. These are all types of applications that can be used for penetration testing:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-227 image-border" src="assets/d6184262-5676-4ee5-b99f-55d1a586eb8c.png" style="width:56.25em;height:42.33em;"/></div>
<p>The <span class="packt_screen">Places</span> menu allows you to access your filesystems - the files that you will be using. This is similar to <span class="packt_screen">My Documents</span> in Windows machines. If we click on <span class="packt_screen">Computer</span>, we can access all of the files and devices, but we rarely use this menu; we usually access it through the <span class="packt_screen">Home</span> icon on the vertical bar toward the left. If we go to <span class="packt_screen">Places</span> and then to Home, we can get access to <span class="packt_screen">Desktop</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Documents</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Downloads</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Music</span>, and so on, the same way that you would in Windows or macOS X. We can even see <span class="packt_screen">Trash</span>, which is where your trash goes. This is just a basic file manager, with back and forward, and you can double-click on a file to run it or double-click on a directory to open it:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-228 image-border" src="assets/d5c0b7c3-1ed9-4082-89a8-a8c152a82203.png" style="width:55.42em;height:41.67em;"/></div>
<p>To the right, there is an icon called <span class="packt_screen">Workspaces</span>; in here, you can see the number of desktops, or workspaces. Linux usually supports workspaces, so you can have different windows on different workspaces; if you don't have other windows open, you can't use the next workspace. However, for example, if you have a file manager open here, you can go to the next workspace and it will be empty, and then you can have something else running there. You can use as many workspaces as you want, and it's easy to switch between them. We will be using them when we perform our penetration testing attacks.</p>
<p>Now, toward the right of the <span class="packt_screen">workspace</span> icon, you can have a <span class="packt_screen">keyboard</span> icon, if you have more than one keyboard and want to switch between them:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-229 image-border" src="assets/007694d1-d0fb-4c7b-9d0f-901d6a6b33c8.png" style="width:56.75em;height:42.75em;"/></div>
<p>We then have our networks icon, as seen in the following screenshot. With it, we can access wired and wireless networks. One thing to note is that we will not be able to access our internal wireless card through a virtual machine. We have set the settings of the computer to be connected through NAT, which means that it has an internet connection, but the internet connection is coming through a host machine. So, there is actually a virtual network set up between this device and the main device. This device only has internet access because of the internet access provided by the main machine:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-230 image-border" src="assets/543113a5-ae43-418c-bd90-1df4ba1d0d61.png" style="width:57.75em;height:43.50em;"/></div>
<p>Here, we can also change the volume from the same menu; we can turn off the computer, lock it, or enter the preferences, too. These are just normal preferences; you should familiarize yourself with them. They include <span class="packt_screen">Backgrounds</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Notifications</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Displays</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Mouse</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Networks</span>. We then have battery settings, which can be accessed from the status bar. <span class="packt_screen">Applications</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Places</span> are the objects we'll be using the most, and you can access your network settings from them.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>If we have a wireless card connected, we will be able to see the available networks. If we want to connect a wireless card (I have a USB wireless card), we can do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the <span class="packt_screen">Devices</span> menu on the menu bar, then go to <span class="packt_screen">USB</span>. This procedure is the same, regardless of the USB device that you connect (wireless, memory stick, and so on). Go to <span class="packt_screen">Devices | USB</span>, then select the device you want to connect.</li>
<li>So we connected a wireless card, and the chipset that's used in the card is called <span class="packt_screen">Ralink 802.11 n WLAN [0101]</span>. This is the wireless card, and we are going to click on it. That should connect it to the Kali machine:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1064 image-border" src="assets/34169b0c-f8b3-421d-bba9-a36407052939.png" style="width:35.83em;height:12.58em;"/></div>
<ol start="3">
<li> G<span>o to the wireless icon on the status bar, </span>go to the <span class="packt_screen">Select Network</span> option in <span class="packt_screen">Wi-Fi Not Connected</span>, and then select a network. Then, we can see the networks that are available around us, and we can select any network that we want to connect to; just enter the password in, and connect to the network normally, the way you would connect to any other network:</li>
</ol>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-242 image-border" src="assets/039b0489-7907-4b35-80b4-c71d0c7db48e.png" style="width:54.00em;height:40.33em;"/></div>
<p>Even if we disconnect our wireless card now, we will see that we still have an internet connection, because our main machine (a macOS X, for example) is connected to a network, and this virtual machine is connected to the Mac machine via an internal virtual network. So, the browser that comes with Kali Linux is Firefox ESR, and we can go to Google and check that we have an internet connection.</p>

<p>These are not hacking commands; they're not penetration testing commands. They're just commands used in Linux that allow us to do different things on the operating system.</p>
<p>This overview of how the Terminal works was just designed to get you more comfortable with the structures, navigating the directories, and so on.</p>
<p>Now, let's take an overview of the Linux Terminal. The Terminal is a place where you can do anything you want on the operating system, run any program by executing commands associated with the program we want. The Linux Terminal is very powerful; it basically allows us to do a lot more than the graphical interface. A lot of the programs that we're going to use have graphical interfaces, but the command line is much easier and quicker. Also, in many scenarios, you will get a Secure Socket Shell (SSH) or Command Prompt on the target computer, and you will need to know the commands in order to do what you wish on the computer, or to pen test its security.</p>
<p>Learning how to deal with the Command Prompt is very important. We're going to use it a lot in the upcoming chapters, but for now, we will provide a very simple overview. It's much easier than running through the graphical interfaces. Using it is very simple; you literally type in the command, and the result is displayed on the screen as text.</p>

<p>The <kbd><span>ls</span></kbd> command lists all of the files and directories that exist in the current working directory. So it's similar to the <kbd>dir</kbd> command in Windows machines; it just lists all of the files and directories that exist in the current directory:</p>
<pre><strong>ls</strong></pre>
<p><span>And, as we execute this command, the output for it lists all of the directories, such as <kbd>Desktop</kbd>, <kbd>Documents</kbd>, <kbd>Downloads</kbd>, and <kbd>Music</kbd>:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-298 image-border" src="assets/04c6641c-c6a1-425f-ae04-05bb73e9d413.png" style="width:43.33em;height:5.17em;"/></div>
<p><span>Let's run <kbd>ls</kbd> with some options. We going to use <kbd>ls</kbd> and then use <kbd>-l</kbd>, and that will show us more information about the files. It's basically the same command that we ran before, but, as we can see in the following screenshot, we now get more information. We can see the total entries that exist in the current working directory, and we can see the same directories that we saw before, but we can also see the dates that they were created or modified. We can see the user responsible for them, and its root use, and we can also see permissions:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-299 image-border" src="assets/0eb73e8c-64be-4432-85de-de7450cf0484.png" style="width:30.58em;height:8.83em;"/></div>
<p><span>We will learn more about permissions in the next chapters. Permissions specify which users can do what (read, write, execute). This is just an example of the <kbd>ls</kbd> command.</span></p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">The man command</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>One of the most important commands, which is going to become handy to you in the future, is the <kbd>man</kbd> command. It stands for <strong>manual</strong>. The <kbd>man</kbd> command can be used to query and get the manual of any other command. For example, we just used the <kbd>ls</kbd> command to list all of the directories that exist in the current working directory:</p>
<pre><strong>man ls</strong></pre>
<p>After running this command, it will show us the manual for the <kbd>ls</kbd> command. And, as we can see, it's showing us that <kbd>ls</kbd> is used to list content, because it lists files and directories. We can also see that this command actually takes options, so it takes more options than just the <kbd>ls</kbd> command:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-239 image-border" src="assets/f461ffb5-96ef-49f2-85dd-9fb02dcd1648.png" style="width:55.50em;height:37.75em;"/></div>
<p>In the preceding screenshot, we can see the format of the options in Linux; it's either a <kbd>-</kbd> letter abbreviation, or <kbd>--</kbd>, and you type in the full option. So, for example, the <kbd>-- all</kbd> option does not ignore entries starting with a dot. If we type in or press the <em>Enter</em> key, the manual will just keep going down so you can read more information. These are all of the options that you can do with the command. We can see, for example, that the <kbd>-l</kbd> uses a long listing format. To quit this command, we just type in <kbd>q</kbd>, so we're out of the manual.</p>


            </article>

        <section>

                            <header>
                    <h1 class="header-title">The help command</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Another really useful option is <kbd>--help</kbd>. We will use <kbd>ls</kbd> again, and do a <kbd>--help</kbd> command. Now, <kbd>man</kbd> and <kbd>--help</kbd> work on almost every command, so you can use <kbd>man ls</kbd>, or <kbd>ls --help</kbd>, and it will always show you the help or the manual page of the program. So, after we execute the preceding command, in the following screenshot, we can see the help page for using <kbd>ls</kbd>, and it tells us all of the options for the <kbd>ls</kbd> command:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-243 image-border" src="assets/2b0cc358-9a5a-4518-9c62-ffe8b2e8990a.png" style="width:41.83em;height:39.42em;"/></div>
<p>Again, it's a <kbd>-</kbd> or a <kbd>--</kbd>, and we enter the option name as we did before. On top, it shows information about what the command does, and it gives the format of the command, so it should be used in this particular format: <kbd>Usage: ls</kbd>. We then enter the options, and then whether we want to do anything to the file. It's very similar to the <kbd>man</kbd> command; sometimes, programs will not have <kbd>man</kbd>, and they'll just have the <kbd>help</kbd> command.</p>
<div class="packt_tip">If we have any command or any program that we are not sure how to use, we can always just type in <kbd>man</kbd> and the name of the command, or the name of the command and <kbd>--help</kbd>. Another useful exercise when dealing with the Terminal is that we can press the up and down arrows to go through the history of the command. So, we can switch between the <kbd>man ls</kbd>, <kbd>ls -l</kbd>, and <kbd>ls --help</kbd> commands through the up and down arrow keys.</div>

                            <header>
                    <h1 class="header-title">The Tab button</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Another useful item is the <em>Tab</em> button on the keyboard. If we are typing a command, or if we are looking for a file and we are just not sure, we can use <em>Tab </em>button to autocomplete. For example, let's suppose that we want to type a filename. Let's first create a file; we<span> just go to <span class="packt_screen">Places</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Home</span>, because right now, we are going to create a new file. Let's create a new folder, called <kbd>test</kbd>. Let's suppose that we are looking to do something with the <kbd>test</kbd> folder; the <kbd>cd</kbd> command can be used to change the working directory to another directory.</span></p>
<p><span>Let's suppose that we want to go into the <kbd>test</kbd> directory; we can use the command, and then find ourselves<span> in the <kbd>test</kbd> directory:</span></span></p>
<pre><strong>cd test/</strong></pre>
<p><span>Another useful command is</span> <kbd>pwd</kbd><span>; it shows you the current working directory. Just</span> execute it,<span> and, as we can see, we're now in the <kbd>root/test</kbd> directory:</span></p>
<pre><strong>pwd</strong></pre>
<p><span>Now, if we want to go back, we can just use <kbd>cd</kbd>, change the directory, and, instead of typing a directory name that we want to go to, we can just type <kbd>cd ..</kbd>.</span></p>
<p><span>These were just basic commands, there are so many commands in Linux. Again, every program that we install on the system will have a Command Prompt version, and we can access that program through the Command Prompt. A lot of the programs that we're going to use will not even have a graphical interface, so we will have to use them through the Terminal. Again, don't be scared of that; we're going to go over it in the future.</span></p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Updating resources</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Now that we know how to interact with the Terminal and Linux basics, we will just look at some final steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updating the source list</li>
<li>Installing <kbd>terminator</kbd></li>
<li>Installing required updates</li>
</ul>
<div class="packt_infobox">Going to the Kali machine, the first thing that I want to show you is viewing the machine in full screen. Just go to <span class="packt_screen">View</span> and then <span class="packt_screen">Full-screen</span>, and that will automatically expand everything and put it in proper full screen.</div>
<p>Let's look at the package manager in Kali Linux. We can install programs using a command called <kbd>apt-get</kbd>. We usually type in <kbd>apt-get</kbd>, and then, if we want to install something, we type <kbd>apt-get install</kbd>, followed by the package name (the program name). Before we do any of that, we have to update the sources; the way this program works is through fetching a number of libraries. On a fresh installation, we want to update our sources, so we make sure that it has the latest sources for the libraries, and the latest available programs. We're just going to use <kbd>apt-get update</kbd>. This command will not update the system; it will only update the list of available programs that can be installed:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-244 image-border" src="assets/d0628b5d-5b2f-4b79-a6fe-dd1e6531fe94.png" style="width:34.17em;height:3.33em;"/></div>
<p>Now, everything has been updated, so we can go ahead and start installing programs. We are going to look at an example of installing a useful Terminal application called <kbd>terminator</kbd>. The command is as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>apt-get install terminator</strong></pre>
<p>Press <em>Enter</em>; now, it will ask us if we really want to install this. We will say yes, by typing <kbd>y</kbd> and hitting <em>Enter</em>, and this will automatically download the application and install it for us:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-245 image-border" src="assets/577f4c31-5dc3-4b87-a4ea-5c197eeaaf2d.png" style="width:51.92em;height:36.92em;"/></div>
<p>Now, we can go ahead and try to use <kbd>terminator</kbd>. To do so, we will go to the <span class="packt_screen">Applications</span> on the menu bar toward the left and search <kbd>terminator</kbd>. We will right-click to add it to <span class="packt_screen">My Favorites</span>, so it shows up in the dock. We are going to open it, it's just another Terminal application. We can increase the size of the text here, and actually run programs through the Terminal, using any of the commands we illustrated previously. The advantage of the Terminator is that we can split the screen and run multiple commands. If we right-click on the screen, we can split it horizontally, and we can have three different windows that can run three different commands or programs at the same time. So, this can be really handy; it can make your life much easier in the future.</p>
<p>One more command involves upgrading our system. In many cases, when we upgrade our system, we face issues such as broken libraries; some of our programs might not work when the libraries they depend on have updated, but the program itself has not. If we face issues, we can restore a previous snapshot; but generally, we just don't upgrade. If there's a new version of Kali, we just import that as another virtual machine, instead of upgrading the existing Kali version.</p>
<p>Now, if you want to upgrade your system, all you have to do is type in <kbd>apt-get upgrade</kbd>. If you press <em>Enter</em>, it will tell you that a large number of libraries and packages will be upgraded. If you hit <em>Enter</em> again, it will start downloading, installing, and configuring these packages as seen in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1065 image-border" src="assets/3263e4b0-d2dd-44b5-a783-5c903308eb82.png" style="width:34.58em;height:18.33em;"/></div>
<p>It might ask you to configure a few things, so don't be too adventurous and try to change things—keep them the way they are. Again, most of the time, we keep everything the same.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we learned what Kali Linux is, and the advantages of using it when it is installed on our virtual machine. After that, we looked through the GUI of Kali Linux, including various icons it has. We then used a few Linux commands that we are going to use in future chapters. Finally, we learned how we can update the resources of our system.</p>
<p>The upcoming chapters will focus on network penetration testing. Initially, we will learn all of the fundamentals; later, we will learn the attacks that we can perform on networks.</p>
