<p><span>In all the attacks that we performed in the previous chapters, we weren't connected to a network. In this chapter, however, we are going to look at attacks that we can perform when we break through the network. Firstly, we are going to learn about all the important information we can gather when we enter a network that will help us to launch attacks; we will be using a netdiscover tool for this purpose. We will also learn about a tool that is </span><span>similar</span><span> to</span><span> netdiscover—namely, AutoScan. This has a better interface and is more powerful than netdiscover.</span> W<span>e will learn about yet another tool called Zenmap, which works in a similar fashion </span><span>to the way AutoScan and netdiscover explore all the clients that are connected to a system.</span></p>
<p><span>In this chapter, we will cover the following topic:</span></p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Post-connection attacks</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Everything we've done so far has not involved us connecting to a network. In this section, we're going to be talking about post-connection attacks—in other words, attacks that we can do after connecting to a network. Now, it doesn't matter if this network is a wireless or a wired network, and it doesn't matter how we managed to connect to it. We're going to forget all about what we did so far, and we're just going to assume that we have a connection to the network. We could have just connected physically using a wire to the router or to the server, we could have managed to crack the key, if the target was using a WEP or WPA key, or perhaps the network was a wireless network that wasn't using any encryption, and we just connected to it. It doesn't matter how we gained our connection; if we have gained access to a network, then we can launch all of the attacks that we're going to talk about in this section.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>One important thing to note first, though, is that in all of the previous attacks we kept our wireless card in monitor mode, so that we could capture any packet that goes in the air. In this section, we're going to be using our wireless cards in managed mode, as we only want to capture packets that are directed to us, because we have access to the network and so we don't really need to capture everything. Another thing to bear in mind is that, if we are testing in our lab and we want to test these attacks without using a number of wireless cards, we should go to the VirtualBox settings of the Kali machine, go to <span class="packt_screen">Setting</span><span> </span>|<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Network</span>, and make sure that it's using the<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">NAT Network</span>, and that it's on the same subdomain (<span class="packt_screen">NatNetwork</span><span>, </span>in our example) as the other virtual machines, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/f5dad30b-8c69-4b8f-8e79-d3ef6e81f67c.png"/></div>
<p>We can use the<span> </span><kbd>eth0</kbd><span> </span>card interface in our attacks from the Kali machine; it's going to be a virtual interface, but it's just going to work as a normal interface. Alternatively, we can use your wireless card—just connect from our Kali, connect to our target network, and then we will be able to test the security of any device that is in our network.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>So, we can connect our virtual machine, or our Windows virtual machine, to the same network, or we can just test any other device that we have, be it our phone, an old laptop, or any other device.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The first thing we're going to talk about in this section is gathering information. Gathering information about the connected clients and the router is very important because it will help us know what their IP and MAC addresses are and the operating system that they're running, as well as the ports that they have open in their devices. As for the router, we'll be able to know the manufacturer of the router, and then we'll be able to look for exploits and vulnerabilities that we can use against the router or against the clients if we are trying to hack them.</p>
<p>In<span> </span><a href="16c0aae0-6766-4e7f-ade5-e359e50c2160.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Network Penetration Testing</em>,<span> </span>we saw how we can use<span> </span><kbd>airodump-ng</kbd><span> </span>to discover connected clients. In the second part of the<span> </span><kbd>airodump-ng</kbd><span> </span>output, we learned how we could see the associated clients and their MAC addresses. That was about it—that's everything we can get before we connect to the target access point. Now, after connecting, we can gather much more detailed information about these devices. There are a lot of programs for this task, but we're going to talk about three programs, starting with the simplest and quickest one—netdiscover.</p>
<p>As we have said before, netdiscover is the quickest and the simplest program to use, but it doesn't show very detailed information about the target clients. It'll only show us their IP address, their MAC address, and sometimes the hardware manufacturer. We're going to use it by typing<span> </span><kbd>netdiscover</kbd>, and then we're going to enter<span> </span><kbd>-i</kbd><span> </span>and specify our wireless device, which is<span> </span><kbd>eth0</kbd>. Then we're going to enter the range, which can be any range we want. Looking at the IP (which is<span> </span><kbd>10.0.2.1</kbd>) tells us which network we are in. We want to discover all the clients that are in this network, so we're going to try and see if there is a device in<span> </span><kbd>10.0.2.1</kbd>. Then we're going to try<span> </span><kbd>12</kbd>,<span> </span><kbd>13</kbd>,<span> </span><kbd>14</kbd>,<span> </span><kbd>15</kbd>,<span> </span><kbd>16</kbd>, up to<span> </span><kbd>254</kbd>—that's the end of the range. So, to specify a whole range, we can write<span> </span><kbd>/24</kbd>. That means we want<span> </span><kbd>10.0.2.1</kbd>, and then this IP is just going to increase up to<span> </span><kbd>10.0.2.254</kbd>, which is the end of the IP range in the network. The command for this is as follows:</p>
<pre><strong> -i eth0 -r 10.0.2.1/24</strong></pre>
<p>We are going to hit<span> </span><em>Enter</em>. It will return the output really fast, producing the result shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1322 image-border" src="assets/d53fe45f-afa5-44e4-9217-f9e267934b95.png" style="width:37.25em;height:10.25em;"/></div>
<p>As we said, it's the quickest way, and we can see in the preceding screenshot that we have four devices connected to the network. We have their<span> </span><kbd>MAC Addresses </kbd>and we have the<span> </span><kbd>MAC Vendor</kbd>. That's about it. The method was very quick, and it just shows simple information.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">The AutoScan tool</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>AutoScan is another program that can be used to discover computers or clients connected to the same network. It's not as fast as netdiscover, but it has a graphical interface, so it's easier to use, and it actually displays more detailed information about the discovered clients. Let's go to the Kali machine and download the Linux version of AutoScan from<span> </span><a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/autoscan/files/AutoScan/autoscan-network%201.42/autoscan-network-1.42-Linux-x86-Install.tar.gz/download" target="_blank">https://sourceforge.net/projects/autoscan/files/AutoScan/autoscan-network%201.42/autoscan-network-1.42-Linux-x86-Install.tar.gz/download</a>. The problem with the latest version (version 1.5) is that it has a bug, so it doesn't work very well. So, what we are going to do is download an older version, which is 1.42. If we go to<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Files</span><span> </span><span class="packt_screen">|</span><span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Downloads</span>, we will see the file. Let's extract that file by right-clicking on it and clicking on<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Extract Here</span> from the drop-down menu. This will bring up the installer.</p>
<p>We will run this installer in the Terminal, but before we do that, there is a library <span>that AutoScan uses </span><span>that we need to install. This library is only available to computers that have a 32-bit architecture, and consequently 32-bit processors, so we need to add that architecture first and then install the library. The first command we're going to enter is for adding 32-bit compatibility to our 64-bit computer. If your computer is already 32-bit, then you don't need to run the command, but if it's a 64- bit computer, then you need to run the command. We are just going to launch the </span><kbd>dpkg --add-architecture i386</kbd><span> </span><span>command</span><span>. Now, we need to update the sources. To do this, we enter</span><span> </span><kbd>apt-get update</kbd><span>. Now, we are going to install the library that AutoScan needs, called</span><span> </span><kbd>libc6</kbd><span>. Run the </span><kbd>apt-get install libc6: i386</kbd><span> command and say</span><span> </span><kbd>Yes</kbd><span> </span><span>when it asks if you want to continue.</span></p>
<p>Later, it will ask us to restart the services as configurations are made—say<span> </span><kbd>Yes</kbd> when it does. OK, now it should be all installed. Now that we have installed the library that AutoScan needs, all we need to do is just install AutoScan itself.</p>
<p>As you might recall, AutoScan was downloaded in the<span> </span><kbd>Downloads</kbd><span> </span>folder. We're going to navigate to the<span> </span><kbd>Downloads</kbd><span> </span>folder by running<span> </span><kbd>cd Downloads</kbd>. Then, if we list the files in<span> </span><kbd>Downloads</kbd><span> </span>using<span> </span><kbd>ls</kbd><span>, </span>we will see that we have the AutoScan installer itself written in green:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1328 image-border" src="assets/6e0309fa-aa58-4152-8c84-afa4a00c1e19.png" style="width:23.25em;height:6.08em;"/></div>
<p>To run the installer, we're going to write<span> </span><kbd>./</kbd><span> </span>and then write the name of the installer—that is,<span> </span><kbd>autoscan-network-1.42-Linux-x86-Install</kbd>—and hit<span> </span><em>Enter</em>:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1329 image-border" src="assets/231e9a3c-8b1a-4e6f-846f-c87175c9215f.png" style="width:30.75em;height:24.33em;"/></div>
<p>It will ask us to click<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Next</span> if we wish to continue installing AutoScan. Once we've confirmed our choice, it will ask us where we want to install it. We are going to keep it in the default place, which is<span> </span><kbd>/opt/AutoScan</kbd>:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1352 image-border" src="assets/ef2bb58f-3fb2-40f5-9b84-cf33b7bc6e76.png" style="width:32.00em;height:25.50em;"/></div>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Now, the<span> </span><span>program </span>should be fully installed. If we go to the desktop, we will see that we now have a launcher on the desktop. Also, if we go to<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Show Applications</span><span> </span>and look for AutoScan, we will see that we have two files; the uninstaller and AutoScan itself:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1353 image-border" src="assets/dd5337a8-1da6-4e6e-bd03-dcd20d0f00e8.png" style="width:23.33em;height:10.58em;"/></div>
<p>We are now going to run AutoScan. We can use it to discover clients that are connected to the same network as us. The AutoScan <span class="packt_screen">Wizard</span><span> (</span>as shown in the following screenshot) will actually help us start the scan and see the results:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1354 image-border" src="assets/9880c703-c192-498c-9c6f-ba3aba2a9edf.png" style="width:34.67em;height:27.50em;"/></div>
<p>We will just click on<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Forward</span>. Next, it will ask us to name the network—we're just going to keep it as<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Local network</span>, and then click <span class="packt_screen">Forward</span>:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1355 image-border" src="assets/fc23ba51-cb45-4c2b-b865-3644748ccd76.png" style="width:35.67em;height:28.25em;"/></div>
<p>Again, it's still going to ask us where the network is. It's our localhost, so we are keeping it as it is:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1356 image-border" src="assets/931c3023-ce10-427a-9766-0e3987a94624.png" style="width:34.92em;height:27.83em;"/></div>
<p>Next, we click<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Forward</span>. Next, AutoScan will show us the available interfaces. This is really important, because, depending on which interface we pick, we will discover the devices that are connected to the same network that this interface is connected to. For example,<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">wlan0 [192.168.0.3]</span><span> </span>is an actual wireless card connected to our real home network, so if we use this interface, we will be able to discover all the devices that are connected to our Wi-Fi home network because<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">wlan0</span> <span class="packt_screen">[192.168.0.3]</span><span> </span>is connected to that network:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1357 image-border" src="assets/a32c2f76-1e99-41b1-9ebf-6d285892b7b3.png" style="width:31.42em;height:24.75em;"/></div>
<p>We are going to click on<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Forward</span>, and then we're going to click on <span class="packt_screen">Forward</span><span> </span>one more time. Now, the program is working, and as we can see in the following screenshot it is already discovering devices in our network:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1359 image-border" src="assets/6e982a02-30f6-475f-b0eb-f752a1cd698d.png" style="width:80.92em;height:55.83em;"/></div>
<p>Give it some time. First of all, it's going to discover the IPs, then it will try to gather information about the open ports, the operating system, and the services used on these open ports.</p>
<p>Once the scan is over, <span>we will be able to see all the devices in our network, </span><span>as we can see in the following screenshot:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1360 image-border" src="assets/b1047227-1a66-48ec-bab4-45a368b1da51.png" style="width:80.83em;height:36.00em;"/></div>
<p>Clicking on any device will show us more information on the right-hand tabs. For example, if we click on the router, as shown in the preceding screenshot, it will get us more information than netdiscover, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1361 image-border" src="assets/fc2266da-0658-4456-8c11-06623fa6d2ed.png" style="width:22.50em;height:12.00em;"/></div>
<p>At first, we can see the<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">IP Address</span> and the<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Mac Address</span>. It's also telling us that<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">This is probably a gateway of the LAN</span>, so it's probably not an actual computer, but a router. Now, in the<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Info</span><span> </span>tab, we can see that we have open ports, and that two of the open <span>ports are</span> a TCP and a UDP port:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1362 image-border" src="assets/0d393d40-e419-472c-a508-1e73efedaed4.png" style="width:21.08em;height:11.00em;"/></div>
<p>As we can see, the tool is easier to use and shows us more information than netdiscover, but it takes a longer time to actually scan the network and discover the information. In the next section, we'll have a look at Zenmap, which will show us more detailed information about the clients that are <span>connected</span><span> to our network.</span></p>

<p>The third program that we're going to look at is<span> </span><strong>Network Mapper</strong><span> </span>(<strong>Nmap</strong>). Nmap is a network discovery tool that can be used to gather information on just about any device. With it, we can gather information about any client that is within our network, we can discover clients that are within our network, we can gather information about clients that are outside our network, and we can gather information about clients just by knowing their IP. We can even can enter their IP and then gather information on them. Nmap is a huge tool, and has many uses. It can be used to bypass firewalls, as well as all kinds of protection and security measures. There are entire books and courses on how to use Nmap. In this section, we're only going to have a quick look at Nmap, and learn some of the basic Nmap commands that can be used to discover clients that are connected to our network, and also discover the open ports on these clients.</p>
<p>We're going use Zenmap, which is the graphical user interface for Nmap. If we just type<span> </span><kbd>zenmap</kbd><span> </span>on the Terminal, we will bring up the application:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1323 image-border" src="assets/c27d50fe-a706-4e4b-b211-898c00eae6a1.png" style="width:32.50em;height:15.25em;"/></div>
<p>In the <span class="packt_screen">Target</span><span> field, </span>we are going to put our IP address. If there is only one IP address that we want to gather information on, we can just enter that address, or we can enter a range, like we did with netdiscover. For this exercise, we will be entering <kbd>10.0.2.1/24</kbd>. In the<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Profile</span> drop-down menu, we can have various profiles:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1324 image-border" src="assets/b56d852e-5e15-452f-a04b-ab88025ffee7.png" style="width:30.50em;height:17.83em;"/></div>
<p>We can put a custom command in the<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Command</span> option if we want, or we can use one of the ready-made profiles in the <span class="packt_screen">Profile</span><span> </span>drop-down menu. Let's look at these ready-made profiles. First, we'll look at the<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Ping scan</span><span> </span>profile first. Select<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Ping scan</span><span> </span>from the<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Profile</span><span> </span>drop-down menu and hit<span> the </span><span class="packt_screen">Scan</span><span> </span>button:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1326 image-border" src="assets/d639ed68-39dc-4de5-abb8-483e5ce80b72.png" style="width:39.50em;height:24.00em;"/></div>
<p>The preceding scan is kind of <span>a </span><span>quick scan, but it doesn't show too much information, as we can see in the preceding screenshot. It only shows the connected devices. As we can see, we have the connected devices on the left-hand panel, and we have their IP addresses, their MAC addresses, and their vendors. Sometimes in netdiscover, we are not able to see the manufacturer of the device. Sometimes this information is also hidden from AutoScan. However, we can see the manufacturer with Nmap, as seen in the preceding screenshot. We are also able to know that the</span><span> </span><kbd>10.0.2.5</kbd><span> </span><span>is a VirtualBox virtual NIC device. This is a virtual wireless card, as we are performing scans in our wired lab. In the case of wireless scans, it will display the manufacturers of the router or device, and we can go ahead and look for exploits in those devices. Again, the</span><span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Ping scan</span><span> </span><span>was very quick. We were able to find out the manufacturers, the IP addresses, and the MAC addresses of the connected clients.</span></p>
<p>The next scan we're going to have a look at is the<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Quick scan</span>. Now, the<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Quick scan</span><span> </span>is going to be slightly slower than the<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Ping scan</span>, but we will get more information than the<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Ping scan</span>; we're going to be able to identify the open ports on each device:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1327 image-border" src="assets/a6860565-67b9-49ae-ae7d-d171bf331b80.png" style="width:106.25em;height:70.08em;"/></div>
<p>As we can see in the preceding screenshot, the main router has<span> an </span><span>open port called </span><span class="packt_screen">53/tcp</span><span>.</span><span> </span></p>
<p>Now, let's have a look at the<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Quick scan plus</span>, which will take the <span class="packt_screen">Quick scan</span> one step further. It's going to be slower than the<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Quick scan</span>, but it will show us the programs that are running on the opened ports. So, in the Quick scan we saw that, for example, port<span> </span><kbd>80</kbd><span> </span>is open, but we didn't know what was running on port<span> </span><kbd>80</kbd>, and we saw that port<span> </span><kbd>22</kbd><span> was </span>running, but we didn't know what was running. We knew it was SSH, but we don't know what SSH server was running on that port.</p>
<p>So again, this will take longer than the<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Quick scan</span>. This scan is slower than all the previous scans that we talked about, but we can see that it gathers much more information, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1364 image-border" src="assets/a67b1b4d-6140-49e7-9f09-0f255c8e80a4.png" style="width:106.58em;height:73.00em;"/></div>
<p>We can see in the preceding screenshot that we have a Linux device connected. We can see that the operating system of the device is connected, and that it also got us the version for the programs. L<span>ast time, we only knew that </span><span>port</span><span> </span><kbd>22 </kbd><span>was open—now we know that it's running, and that the server that's running there is OpenSSH 4.7.</span></p>
<p>From the information that the<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Quick scan </span><span>provided us about </span>our Linux device, we were able to identify port<span> </span><kbd>80</kbd><span>, </span>and could tell that the port was open. We knew that HTTP was running on this, obviously, but we didn't know what version of the server was running on it. Now we know that it was Apache HTTP server 2.2.8 and that it was a Linux device. So again, this is very accurate. We can go ahead and look for exploits and vulnerabilities. </p>
<p>This is just an example of how useful it is to gather information. Even if this didn't work, we could go ahead and look for exploits for these programs and we will manage to gain access to this network. So, gathering information is a huge step in penetration testing. Zenmap, or Nmap, is a huge tool that we can use to carry out many types of scans. We can experiment with these ready-made profiles to see what they can do.</p>

<p><span>In this chapter, we have covered all the possible techniques that we can use to break through network and gather important pieces of information about the clients on the network. This will help us to launch attacks on the target system. For this purpose, we learned about three different tools—netdiscover, AutoScan, </span><span>and </span><span>Zenmap. All these tools have unique features that make them efficient in gathering information about targets. </span></p>
<p>In the next chapter, we are going to learn about various man-in-the-middle attacks. We will also be learning about the Wireshark tool.</p>
