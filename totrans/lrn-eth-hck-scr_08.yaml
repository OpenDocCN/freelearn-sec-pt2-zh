    framework **(**MITMf**), which is a toolkit for one of the most powerful attacks.
    In order to implement MITMf we are going to use ARP spoofing, bypassing HTTPS, and DNS
    spoofing. We will also use keyloggers, and look at the code injection technique

    (**MITM**) attacks. This is one of the most dangerous and effective attacks that
    we can carry out in a network. We can only do it once we have connected to the
    network. It can be used to redirect the flow of packets from any client to our
    device. This means that any packet that is sent to or from the client will have
    to go through our device, and since we know the password we know the key to the
    network, so we will be able to read those packets. They won't be encrypted, and
    we will be able to modify them, drop them, or just read them to see if they contain
    passwords or important information. This attack is so effective because it's very
    hard to protect against. We're going to talk about the ways to protect against
    it, but it's very hard to fully protect against this attack. This is due to the
    way the ARP protocol works. It was programmed in a way that's very simple and
    very effective, but it's not secure enough.

  zh: 在接下来的几个章节中，我们将讨论所谓的**中间人**（**MITM**）攻击。这是我们在网络中可以执行的最危险、最有效的攻击之一。只有在连接到网络后，我们才能进行此攻击。它可以用于将数据包的流量从任何客户端重定向到我们的设备。这意味着，发送到客户端或从客户端发送的任何数据包都必须经过我们的设备，并且由于我们知道密码，因此知道网络的密钥，我们就能读取这些数据包。它们不会被加密，我们将能够修改它们、丢弃它们，或者仅仅读取它们，看它们是否包含密码或重要信息。这个攻击非常有效，因为它很难防御。我们会讨论如何防御这种攻击，但完全防御这种攻击非常困难。这是因为ARP协议的工作方式。它的设计非常简单而且有效，但安全性不足。
- en: ARP has two main security issues. The first one is that each ARP request or
    response is trusted, so whatever our device says to other devices that are in
    our network will be trusted. We can just tell any device that's on our network
    that we are the router and the device will trust us. It will not try to make sure
    that we are actually the router. It will not run any tests to ensure our identity.
    If we tell any device that we are the router, the device will believe us. In the
    same way, if we tell the router that we are someone else on the network, the router
    will trust us and will start treating us as that device; so, that's the first
    security issue. The second security issue is that clients can accept responses
    even if they didn't send a request. So, for example, when a device connects to
    the network, the first thing it's going to ask is, who is the router? And then
    the router will send a response saying "I am the router." Now, we can just send
    a response without the device asking who the router is. We can just tell the device
    we are the router, and because the devices trust anyone, they will trust us start
    sending us packets instead of sending the packets to the router.

  zh: ARP有两个主要的安全问题。第一个是每个ARP请求或响应都是被信任的，所以我们设备对其他设备说的任何内容都会被信任。我们可以告诉网络中的任何设备我们是路由器，设备会信任我们。它不会去验证我们是否真的是路由器，也不会做任何身份验证测试。如果我们告诉任何设备我们是路由器，它会相信我们。同样地，如果我们告诉路由器我们是网络中的另一个设备，路由器也会信任我们，并开始将我们当作那个设备来处理；这就是第一个安全问题。第二个安全问题是客户端可以接受即使它没有发送请求的响应。例如，当一个设备连接到网络时，它首先会询问“谁是路由器？”，然后路由器会发送一个响应，表示“我就是路由器”。现在，我们可以在设备没有询问路由器是谁的情况下直接发送响应。我们可以直接告诉设备我们是路由器，且由于设备信任任何人，它们会信任我们，并开始将数据包发送给我们，而不是发送给路由器。
- en: 'So, let''s have a deeper look at how this MITM attack works. It''s going to
    work using a technique called ARP poisoning, or ARP spoofing. This is done by
    exploiting the two security issues that we talked about in the previous paragraph.
    That''s a typical Wi-Fi network, and we can see in the following diagram that
    when the client requests something it will send the request to the **Wi-Fi router**,
    and then the router will get the request from the internet and come back with
    the responses to the **Client**:'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 那么，让我们更深入地看看这个MITM攻击是如何运作的。它将通过一种叫做ARP中毒或ARP欺骗的技术来进行。通过利用前一段中提到的两个安全问题，这种攻击得以实现。以下是典型的Wi-Fi网络，我们可以在图示中看到，当客户端请求某个内容时，它会将请求发送给**Wi-Fi路由器**，然后路由器从互联网获取请求，并将响应发送回**客户端**：

  zh: '![](assets/e3024871-2d17-49ff-abee-62061787b54a.png)'
- en: Now, all this is done using packets. So, what we are going to do is we're going
    to send an ARP response to the **Client **so that we can send responses without
    the **Client** asking them. The **Client** didn't ask for anything, but we can
    still send it a response. We're going to say that our IP is the router IP. So,
    the router, for example, has the IP `192.168.1.1`; we're going to tell the **Client**the
    device with the IP `192.168.1.1` has our MAC address, so we're going to tell the
    **Client **that we are the router, basically.
  id: totrans-11
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 现在，所有这些操作都是通过数据包完成的。所以，我们要做的是向**客户端**发送一个ARP响应，这样我们就可以在**客户端**没有请求的情况下发送响应。**客户端**并没有请求任何内容，但我们仍然可以给它发送响应。我们将告诉它我们的IP是路由器的IP。例如，路由器的IP是`192.168.1.1`；我们将告诉**客户端**，IP为`192.168.1.1`的设备拥有我们的MAC地址，因此我们基本上是在告诉**客户端**我们就是路由器。
- en: 'This will cause the **Client**to start sending the packets to us instead of
    sending the packets to the router. The following diagram illustrates this:'
  id: totrans-12

  zh: 这将导致**客户端**开始将数据包发送给我们，而不是发送给路由器。下图说明了这一点：

    to tell the router that we are the client. We''ll do this by telling the router
    that our IP is the **Client** IP, and that **Client** has our MAC address, so
    the communication of packets will be done through the MAC address, and the **Wi-Fi
    router** will start sending any packet that''s meant to go to the **Client** to
    us instead. This will redirect the flow of packets through our device, so when
    the **Client** wants to send a request it will send the request to us:'
  id: totrans-14
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 之后，我们将对Wi-Fi路由器做相反的操作。我们将告诉路由器我们是客户端。我们会通过告诉路由器我们的IP是**客户端**的IP，并且**客户端**拥有我们的MAC地址，来实现这一点，这样数据包的通信将通过MAC地址进行，**Wi-Fi路由器**将开始将任何原本要发送到**客户端**的数据包发送给我们。这样，数据包的流动就会被重定向到我们的设备，当**客户端**想要发送请求时，它将把请求发送给我们：

- en: Now, our device will go to the **Wi-Fi router**, it'll get Google, the **Wi-Fi
    router** will send the response to our device instead of the **Client**, and then
    we will send the packet back. So, this means that each packet that is sent to
    the **Client** or from the **Client**, will have to go through us. Since it's
    going through us and we have the key, we can read these packets, we can modify
    them, or we can just drop them.

  zh: 现在，我们的设备将去访问**Wi-Fi路由器**，它将获取Google，**Wi-Fi路由器**会将响应发送到我们的设备，而不是发送给**客户端**，然后我们会把数据包发送回去。这意味着每个发送到**客户端**或从**客户端**发出的数据包，都必须通过我们。既然数据包会通过我们，而我们拥有密钥，那么我们就可以读取这些数据包、修改它们，或者直接丢弃它们。
- en: So, that's the basic principle of the MITM attack and ARP poisoning. Basically,
    we're going to tell the **Client** that we are the **Wi-Fi router**, and then
    we're going to tell the router that we are the **Client**. This will put us in
    the middle of the packet flow, between the **Client** and the **Wi-Fi router**,
    and all the packets will start flowing through our device. Then we can read the
    packets, modify them, or drop them.

  zh: 所以，这就是MITM攻击和ARP中毒的基本原理。基本上，我们将告诉**客户端**我们是**Wi-Fi路由器**，然后我们再告诉路由器我们是**客户端**。这样，我们就会处于数据包流的中间，位于**客户端**和**Wi-Fi路由器**之间，所有的数据包都会通过我们的设备流动。然后我们可以读取这些数据包、修改它们，或者丢弃它们。

    That way, the person will be suspicious and probably won''t log in to that page.

    and what that does is this; basically, the browser comes in with a pre-hardcoded
    list of websites that have to be browsed as HTTPS. So, even if we try to downgrade
    the HTTPS connection to HTTP, the browser will just refuse to show the website,
    or just show a HTTPS version of it. This is because, without connecting to anything,
    the browser has a list stored locally on the local computer saying that it shouldn't
    open Facebook, Gmail, and such websites as HTTP. So, whatever way we try to do
    it, the website will just refuse to open in HTTP.

- en: Now, MITMf actually has, an HSTS plugin that attempts to bypass HSTS, but it
    only works against old browsers. It used to use an old vulnerability, which is
    patched now in new browsers. With new browsers, there is no way of bypassing the
    HTTPS connection to Gmail and Facebook at the moment because they use HSTS, which
    basically means they come in with a hardcoded list, so the browser refuses to
    open these websites as HTTP.

    browser, into the target computer. Since we're the MITM and since everything flows
    through our device, when someone requests a page we can actually insert any type
    of code that we want into that page. Browsers can run two types of code; they
    can run HTML code, and they can run JavaScript code. HTML code is the code responsible
    for the way that the page looks, so it's the code for the buttons, for the text,
    for the images, all of that. It can't really be used to do anything that will
    allow us to gain any access to the target computer. JavaScript, on the other hand,
    is a programming language that can be used to do many things, and we'll see that
    in later sections. In this section, we'll see how to inject JavaScript code into
    the target browser. We can use the same method to inject HTML, but JavaScript
    is more useful. That's why we're going to use our example to inject JavaScript.

    is a network protocol analyzer. It's not designed for hackers, and it's not designed
    for hacking and spying on other people on the network. It's designed for network
    administrators so that they can see what's happening in their network and make
    sure that everything is working properly, and that nobody is doing anything bad
    or suspicious on the network. The way that Wireshark works is it allows you to
    select an interface and then logs all the packets, or all the traffic, that flows
    through that interface. So, we are selecting an interface (it could be a wireless
    card, or it could be a wired card on our current computer), and then it'll start
    logging all the information that flows through that interface. It also has a really
    nice graphical interface that allows us to analyze this traffic, so it allows
    us to filter these packets based on the protocol used in them, such as HTTP or
    TCP. It also allows us to look for certain things, such as cookies or `POST` or
    `GET` requests, and it also allows us to search through these packets. We can
    search through the information that's stored in the packets, and find the things
    that we are looking for. This tool has a vast number of applications, and we might
    need a entire book to cover them all, so in this book we're actually going to
    use it in just a few sections, just covering the basics and the things that are
    related to us.

    to capture the traffic that flows through our own computer, or interface. So,
    we are just going to go to Kali, and we're going to start Wireshark. We can run
    the `wireshark` command from the Terminal. First of all, you can actually just
    go to File | Open, and in here you can open a file that we've already captured.
    For example, you may have captured packets using a different sniffer, such as
    Airodump, MITMf, or TShark, which is the Terminal part of Wireshark.

    on the fly. Sometimes we just want to capture traffic from a small laptop, or
    from our phone, and we may not even be at home. We may be somewhere else doing
    our pen test, and then we go back home and then we want to analyze what we captured.
    In such cases, we can store that in a file and then just open Wireshark and open
    the file that we want to analyze. The main idea here is that Wireshark is not
    a hacking tool, it's not going to capture things happening in another device.
    It will only capture things that flow through our own interface.

    be captured by the Kali machine.

    see things that go through our own computer? Why are we talking about it? Well,
    we're talking about it because we've seen that there are many ways that we can
    become the MITM.

- en: Now, we talked about two methods of becoming the MITM. We talked about doing
    it using ARP spoofing, and if we create a fake access point then we'll naturally
    be the MITM because all the requests will be going through the fake access point
    and start sniffing on the interface that's used to become the MITM. We'll be able
    to capture all the traffic generated by the people that we're targeting in our
    MITM attack. So, if we start a fake access point, we can start sniffing on the
    interface that's broadcasting the signal, and we can capture all the packets sent
    to or received by anyone who is connected to that fake access point. If we become
    the MITM using ARP spoofing, then just select the interface that we used when
    we launched our ARP spoofing attack. We are going to perform this with ARP spoofing
    because it's quicker and easier than generating a fake access point, but again,
    this works on both ways. It even works if we manage to become the MITM using a
    different method. Just make sure we select the interface that's used to launch
    that attack.

    going to specify the `--gateway`, `10.0.2.1`, and then the `--target`, which is
    `10.0.2.5`. So, we performed this command before. It will just put us as the MITM.
    It''ll redirect the traffic from the computer that has the IP `10.0.2.5` to our
    computer, placing us in the middle. Run the attack using the following command:'

    own local machine. It's not sniffing it from the network, it's not sniffing it

    on the interface that we are broadcasting from. If we are performing this attack
    with a real wireless network, if we are connected to our home wireless network
    using wlan0, then we can perform it with wlan0. But with ARP spoofing, we have
    to first redirect the traffic. Then we can use Wireshark. Now, this is just to
    show what Wireshark is and how it works, and we just want to stress the idea that
    Wireshark is not a hacking tool. It's only a program that allows us to log packets
    flowing through a certain interface and then analyze these packets. So, in the
