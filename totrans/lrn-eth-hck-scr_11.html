<p>In this section, we will look at Metasploit Community. This is a web GUI that uses Metasploit, but it has features other than exploiting vulnerabilities. It can be used to discover open ports, just like Zenmap, and install services, but it doesn't stop there. It also maps these ports and services to existing exploits in Metasploit and existing modules. From there you can literally exploit a vulnerability straight away using Metasploit. Let's see how we can use it, and it will become clearer what it can be used for.</p>
<p>The tool is not included in Kali Linux. We need to download it from <a href="https://www.rapid7.com/products/metasploit/metasploit-community-registration.jsp" target="_blank">https://www.rapid7.com/products/metasploit/metasploit-community-registration.jsp</a>. We will also need to use our email address because we will need the product activation key, which they'll send to the email that we enter when we download. Once we download this, we're going to navigate to our<span> </span><kbd>Downloads</kbd><span> </span>using the<span> </span><kbd>cd</kbd><span> </span>command to change directory. If we do<span> </span><kbd>ls</kbd><span> </span>to list the current files, we will be able to see that we have the installer <kbd>metasploit-latest-linux-x64-installer.run</kbd> file <span>downloaded</span>. The first thing we need to do is to change the permissions to an executable so that we can execute this file. To change the permissions in Linux, you use the <kbd>chmod</kbd><span> command</span><span>, and then we will put in the permissions that we want to set, which is executable,</span><span> </span><kbd>+x</kbd><span>, and we are going to put the filename, which is</span><span> </span><kbd>metasploit-latest-linux-x64-installer.run</kbd><span>. Now, we will launch the command, which is as follows:</span></p>
<pre><strong>chmod +x metasploit-latest-linux-x64-installer.run</strong></pre>
<p>And if we do<span> </span><kbd>ls</kbd><span> </span>we will see that there is text that will be highlighted in green, which means that it's an executable:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-395 image-border" src="assets/1dde7393-06ea-4e42-98c1-015e87c4e4d2.png" style="width:42.58em;height:6.75em;"/></div>
<p>To run any executable in Linux all we have to do is type in <kbd>./</kbd><span> </span>and enter the filename. The <kbd>./metasploit-latest-linux-x64-installer.run</kbd> file will run this executable for us. Now, we will just run through the process. </p>
<p>The installation is very simple:</p>
<ol>
<li><span> First, we click on <span class="packt_screen">I accept the agreement</span>, and then we click <span class="packt_screen">Forward</span>. We then select where we want to install it:</span></li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-396 image-border" src="assets/ee87f777-0242-4890-b8c6-588c4c542387.png" style="width:28.25em;height:21.58em;"/></div>
<div class="packt_tip">It will say that the folder is not empty if we already have Metasploit there. If we want to reinstall it we are just going to call it metasploit2.</div>
<ol start="2">
<li>It will ask us whether we want to start Metasploit as a service every time the machine starts. We can pick<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Yes</span><span> </span>or<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">No</span>. I prefer to pick<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">No</span>, but you can set it to<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Yes</span>. Then the Metasploit UI will start automatically every time your computer starts. Click on<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Forward</span>:</li>
</ol>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-397 image-border" src="assets/26055a75-08fe-4a78-a202-9c98395592a6.png" style="width:27.67em;height:21.17em;"/></div>
<ol start="3">
<li>Then it's going to ask us for the<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">SSL Port</span><span> </span>that will be used. Because the service runs as a web GUI, we can set that to anything we want, but we are going to leave it as<span> </span><kbd>3790</kbd>:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-398 image-border" src="assets/8146c863-6eaf-43e9-8a4a-6e11c75f49f7.png" style="width:27.17em;height:20.75em;"/></div>
<ol start="4">
<li>And then it's asking us for the<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Server Name</span>, and we are going to keep it as<span> </span><kbd>localhost</kbd><span> </span>because it's being installed on our<span> </span><kbd>localhost</kbd>:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-399 image-border" src="assets/cf00b5d4-dd44-48c9-b30b-d81ff3165a31.png" style="width:26.00em;height:19.67em;"/></div>
<ol start="5">
<li><span class="packt_screen">Database Server port</span>; again keep this the same, don't change it. Then there is the thin cluster port; again, keep this the same,<span> </span><kbd>7337</kbd>. These are all configurations for the program to run. We don't really need to mess with them. Only change them if you already installed the program and it won't let you have the same port, but usually it should keep them the same:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref"><img src="assets/b67d4764-8dad-48e2-80f2-2220bf478983.png" style="width:25.58em;height:19.58em;"/></div>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Setting  the database server port</div>
<ol start="6">
<li>Now, it's saying it's ready to install. Once you press<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Forward</span><span> </span>it will install it for you and it will ask you for a username and a password for the web interface. Set that as well, pick a username and a password, and the process will finish up smoothly.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, once we finish the installer we want to run the <kbd>metasploit</kbd> service. Because it's going to be installed as a service, as a web server, when we want to use Metasploit Community we will have to run it using the <kbd>service</kbd> command, the same way we run any service in Linux. We enter <kbd>service metasploit start</kbd> to start that service. Once the service has started, all we have to do is go to a browser and navigate to <kbd>https</kbd>. Make sure to put <kbd>https</kbd> not <kbd>http://localhost/</kbd>, and then we enter the port that Metasploit runs on, which is <kbd>3790</kbd>. Press <em>Enter.</em><span> </span>Now it's asking us to log in. We log in using the username and password that we picked while we installed the program, and then we will be able to use it. We'll be talking about logging in and using the tool in the next section.</p>

<p>Now, we are going to log in using the username and password that we set when we installed the tool. As we can see in the following screenshot, we have a web interface for using the tool:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref"><img src="assets/939175f3-5d1c-4471-9427-70ee44316f7d.png" style="width:54.33em;height:33.75em;"/></div>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Web Interface of Metasploit community</div>
<p>Now, we can access the account and go to our user settings or log out. We can also check for software updates.</p>
<p><span>The first time we log in, it will ask us to enter the activation key. The activation key will be sent as an email to the email address that we put when we downloaded the tool. Make sure you put a valid email address when you download the tool.</span></p>
<p>We're going to start a scan, and we are going to click on<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Project</span> |<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">New Project</span>. We are going to call this project<span> </span><kbd>metasploitable</kbd>, we are going to leave the<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Description</span><span> </span>empty, and then it's asking us for a<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Network range</span>. We can set that the same way we did with Zenmap. We can set it to a range. It actually has a range that is within our subnet at the moment. It's<span> </span><kbd>10.0.2.1</kbd> up to<span> </span><kbd>254</kbd>. We can scan the whole network for vulnerabilities and exploits but for now, we're not going to do that; we're only going to target<span> </span><kbd>10.0.2.4</kbd>, which is the Metasploitable machine.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mceNonEditable"/>
<p>Now, we are going to click on <span class="packt_screen">Create Project</span>. The following screenshot shows all the parameters we discussed:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref"><img src="assets/90c43e85-b4c5-4d87-93cd-56dd21a4a3d0.png" style="width:53.75em;height:27.08em;"/></div>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Adding network range</div>
<p>Now, the project has been created and we're going to start a scan on it. We are going to go on the<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Scan</span><span> </span>button on the left side of the screen and click that. We can just launch the scan like this, or we can go on<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Show Advanced Options</span><span> </span>to set some advanced options. If we have a range, we can use the exclude address to exclude some IPs. For example, if we were targeting the whole network from<span> </span><kbd>1</kbd><span> </span>to<span> </span><kbd>254</kbd>, we can exclude our computer by just typing<span> </span><kbd>10.0.2.15</kbd>, which is our IP, to exclude it from the search. You can also put a custom Nmap argument because Metasploit will actually use Nmap to get the services and the installed applications. We can add additional TCP ports or take away TCP ports. Again, we can do the same. We can even set the speed. We also have the UDP service discovery. It actually discovers the service that's installed on the port. We can also set credentials. If the target computer uses some sort of authentication then we can set it up, but our target doesn't use any of that, so we're fine. We can also set a tag for the target computer, or for the target scan. Now, we are not going to mess with these settings. Keep everything the same to keep it simple, and we are going to launch the scan. Give it some time to do the scan, and once this is over we'll see how we can analyze and discover, and see what we can do with the discovered information.</p>

<p>The scan process is over. It will nearly take two minutes, and it will discover one new host, because we only had one host, with<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">33</span><span> </span>new services installed on it. Now, we're going to go back and click on my Metasploitable machine to see what we have discovered. We can see in the following screenshot it has found<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">33</span><span> </span>services and also it managed to detect one vulnerability:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"/>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/b3a9072e-71d7-4e5a-9be9-6bee77512611.png"/></div>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Results of Metasploitable scan</div>
<p>Go to<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Analysis</span><span> </span>|<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Hosts</span>, and we will that see that we have our host here, and it has been scanned correctly. It's a VMware, it's a<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">server</span><span>, </span>and it's running on<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Linux 8.04</span>:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/8cb75b3a-dd47-41d9-983d-bd796a21fabc.png"/></div>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Host Scan</div>
<p>If we click on the IP, we will see in the following screenshot. The first thing that we see is the installed services:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/2ea770b6-ee4f-4168-b37a-c8d413c5ca72.png"/></div>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Installed services</div>
<p>We can see the<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">NAME</span><span> </span>of the service, for example,<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">dns</span>, running on port<span> </span><kbd>53</kbd>; the<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">PROTO</span>, which means the protocol is<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">udp</span>; it's an<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">open</span><span> </span>port; and also we have the<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">SERVICE INFORMATION</span>.</p>
<p>You can switch through pages using the arrow buttons at the bottom-right of the page. It will show same results as Nmap, just with a better GUI. The<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Sessions</span><span> </span>tab is where we see the connections. If we exploited anything, we will see them in the sessions. The GUI looks like this:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/9ebd4717-06c0-4f35-a9c7-beed49610da6.png"/></div>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Exploited sessions</div>
<p>The<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Vulnerabilities</span><span> </span>tab will show you the vulnerabilities that have been discovered. With Nmap, we only got the services. In Metasploitable, it actually maps if it finds a vulnerability, and if Metasploit has an exploitation for that vulnerability it will actually show it to us. We can click on it and get more information about the vulnerability. The<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Credentials</span><span> </span>tab will show you if there are any interesting credentials that the program managed to find. We can see in the following screenshot that it's managed to find the username and the password <span>for PostgreSQL</span><span>, which is</span><span> </span><span class="packt_screen">postgres.</span><span> It's a weak password, and that is the password for the</span><span> </span><span class="packt_screen">admin</span>. I<span>f we click on the key icon under the</span><span> </span><span class="packt_screen">VALIDATE</span><span> </span><span>column it will validate it for us, turning the status to</span><span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Validated</span><span> in the </span><span><span class="packt_screen">VALIDATION</span> column</span><span>:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/8b498ee4-3590-4575-84df-899f85d9d591.png"/></div>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Credentials</div>
<p>Now, we can use the preceding information. We can go ahead and connect to the SQL database here using this information, using the username<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">postgres</span><span> </span>and the password<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">postgres</span>. Let's look at a quick example of this. We are going to our Terminal in Kali and we're going to use the command that you used to connect to SQL, to PostgreSQL. It's<span> </span><kbd>psql</kbd>. Put the IP that we want to connect to after the<span> </span><kbd>-h</kbd><span> </span>option. The command is as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>psql -h 10.0.2.4 postgres</strong></pre>
<p>Then, we enter the username. Now, it will ask for the password, and we're going to enter the password that we captured, which is postgres. We will be logged in to the database. We can run any SQL command now on the target computer. SQL is the language that is used to communicate with databases. We not going to go into too much detail here, just that we managed to capture a username and a password for a database, and the database we can communicate with using the SQL language. We can run the <kbd>select current_database();</kbd> command just as an example. We can see that it selected our<span> </span><kbd>current_database</kbd>, which is also called<span> </span><kbd>postgres</kbd>. Just a quick example to show that the captured data is correct; in Metasploit, in the<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Captured Data</span><span> </span>tab, there is no captured data from the file or from the target computer. But on<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Notes</span>,<span> </span>we will see some interesting notes, some of them about the HTTP requests for some of the methods that we use. We can go through the notes, which can be useful for the information gathering process.</p>
<p>The <span class="packt_screen">File Shares</span><span> </span>tab will show us any files being shared from the target computer. The<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Attempts</span> tab will show you the attempts that we did on the target computer, and the<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Modules</span> tab will show us the modules that can be used to exploit any found vulnerabilities. We have a vulnerability called the<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Java RMI Server</span>, and we have a module to discover the<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Java RMI Server</span><span> </span>vulnerability. We're going to launch <span class="packt_screen">Exploit: Java RMI Server Insecure Default Configuration Java Code Execution</span>, and we will do this launch straight from the tool. We're just going to click on <span class="packt_screen">Launch</span>. It will allow us to run the exploit from within Metasploit Community. <kbd>exploit/multi/misc/java_rmi_server</kbd><span> </span>is the module name; do<span> </span><kbd>use exploit/multi/misc/java_rmi_server</kbd>, set the<span> </span><kbd>PAYLOAD</kbd>, set the<span> </span><kbd>LHOST</kbd>, set the<span> </span><kbd>RHOST</kbd>, and then<span> </span><kbd>exploit</kbd>, the same way that we did it before in<span> </span><kbd>msfconsole</kbd>. Alternatively, we can let Metasploit Community do all the work for us.</p>
<p>We can see that it already picked the target address correctly, and we are going to set the connection to<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Reverse</span>, and <span>we are going to keep </span><span>the</span><span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Payload Type</span><span> </span><span>as</span><span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Meterpreter</span><span>. Now, we can choose the command shell as we can see in the following screenshot, which is what we used before, and</span> <span class="packt_screen">Meterpreter</span><span> </span><span>is just a different type of payload that we'll talk about later. Now, we are just going to run the module by clicking on</span><span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Run Module</span><span>:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/f3c8459f-d47f-40eb-b58c-72cb02349e1b.png"/></div>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Selection of command shell</div>
<p>As we can see in the following screenshot, the module did run and the output is very similar to what you get from the Metasploit console, and it says that session 1 is open. It has already created a session for us. Now, we can communicate with it:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/ec947ac8-c83c-4fe0-881f-7a7e4b5e3507.png"/></div>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Output of the Command shell</div>
<p>We can see the<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Session</span><span> </span>tab as seen in the preceding screenshot. It has the number<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">1</span>. If we click on that we will see that, we have a session open and it's on the Metasploitable machine, or on the Metasploitable project, and it used the Java RMI Server. If we click on that session we will see all the things that we can do on that computer. Now, we can use <span class="packt_screen">Collect System Data</span><span> </span>to get some sensitive data, but we won't be able to use that because it's all for the Pro version, and we have the Community version. We can use<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Access Filesystem</span>, and we can literally have a web-based file browser. We can browse through the files of the target computer. Or we can just get a Command Prompt for the Meterpreter, like what we used to get before. If we go to<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Command shell</span> by going to the previous page, we will see that we have a Meterpreter command shell that allows us to use the Meterpreter payload.</p>
<p>Now, we are going to study the Meterpreter payload and how to use it in the post-exploitation, but we are just going to see that we have full access to the target computer from here and that we are able to do whatever we want to do on it. Metasploit did everything through the browser. We didn't have to go and run Metasploit and manually configure the payload and the exploit. Now, there is one last thing that we will see, which is the<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Modules</span><span> </span>tab. Some of these modules don't have to give us full access. Some of them can only be used to do a denial of service, and some of them are code execution vulnerabilities, but they might not work. We can try them and see if they work. We can click on them and run them from within the computer.</p>
<p>In the gathering module, it doesn't exploit anything. It just allows us to upload files, and some of them give us a Meterpreter session. Just click on it, and we can run it from within the web interface. The tool also offers other features, such as the Web Apps feature, which scans for web apps. We can just go to report options, where we can create a report of the findings of everything that has been found, but the problem is these features are limited to the Pro edition. We can't really use them unless we pay for the program.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>In this section, we will discuss a tool called Nexpose. Nexpose is made by Rapid7. It's made by the same people that made Metasploit and Metasploit Community, and it's similar to Metasploit Community in the sense that it has a web GUI and it allows us to discover, assess, and act on discovered vulnerabilities. It also maps these vulnerabilities to existing exploits, but the difference is Metasploit Community only showed us exploits that can be used within Metasploit, whereas Nexpose actually shows us exploits that have been published somewhere other than Rapid7 and Metasploit. It works on a larger scale, it shows us more vulnerabilities, and it also helps us to create a report at the end of the scan so that we can share it with the technical people, and a <span>high-level </span>small report that can be shared with the managers. It also helps us create schedule scans. Suppose, for example, we have a company, or we are working on a big infrastructure and we want to do regular scans every week or every month; we can do that using this tool.</p>
<p>Let's see how to install it and run it, and the differences will become more clear:</p>
<ol>
<li>Nexpose doesn't come pre-installed in Kali Linux; we have to install it manually. To download it you need to download it from <a href="https://www.rapid7.com/products/nexpose/download/" target="_blank">https://www.rapid7.com/products/nexpose/download/</a>. It'll ask you to fill in your name and address. Fill it in and download it. We will download the Community version, which is free. The first thing <span>we are going to do before we can install it</span> is stop the PostgreSQL service that comes it installed with, or that is running in Kali Linux. Just launch the <kbd>service postgresql stop</kbd><span> command, </span>which will stop the SQL service.</li>
<li>Usually, when we run the Terminal we won't be in the<span> </span><kbd>Downloads</kbd><span> </span>directory. We will need to change our directory to the<span> </span><kbd>Downloads</kbd><span> </span>directory using the<span> </span><kbd>cd</kbd><span> </span>command. Once we're in the<span> </span><kbd>Downloads</kbd> directory we can list all the available files, and we will find the<span> </span><kbd>Nexpose <span>Rapid7Setup-Linux64.bin</span></kbd><span> </span>setup file. We need to change the permissions of this to an executable. If you have already changed the permissions, that's when it will appear in green if we do the<span> </span><kbd>ls</kbd><span> </span>command. Let's first use the<span> </span><kbd>chmod</kbd><span> </span>command to change the permissions so that we can execute that file. The command will be<span> </span><kbd>chmod +x filename</kbd>; <kbd>filename</kbd><span> </span>is the file that we want to change the permission of; for us it's<span> </span><kbd>Rapid7Setup-Linux64.bin</kbd>. Here is the command:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 90px"><strong><span>chmod +x Rapid7Setup-Linux64.bin</span></strong></pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>Now to run this installer. To run an executable in Linux systems, all we have to do is type <kbd>./</kbd><span> </span>then enter the file that you want to run. For us, it's<span> </span><kbd><span>Rapid7Setup-Linux64.bin</span></kbd>. The command will be as follows:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign CDPAlignLeft" style="padding-left: 90px"><strong><span>./Rapid7Setup-Linux64.bin</span></strong></pre>
<p class="mce-root" style="padding-left: 60px">An installer<span> </span><span>will pop up, as seen in the following screenshot:</span></p>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1174 image-border" src="assets/38ca95d0-767b-45d9-b6fb-89e263984d70.png" style="width:53.83em;height:44.75em;"/></div>
<ol start="4">
<li>Now, all we have to do is click<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Next</span>, and then it will ask us to accept the agreement. We are going to install the console with the scan engine. We might come across a problem. Nexpose is only compatible with Kali 2. If we want to go ahead with this, we're going to modify two files on our local system to make our system look like Kali 2 so that the installer will let us install it on our system. But if you don't face this issue, then you can just click<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Next</span><span> at </span>this point, but we will just go through the steps and modify two files to make my system look like Kali 2.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li>Follow these steps only if you get an error saying your system is not compatible:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none">
<ul>
<li>Click on<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Finish</span>. The f<span>ile that contains the instructions that we need to change the version of our system to Kali 2 is in this book's GitHub repository (<a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Fundamentals-of-Ethical-Hacking-from-Scratch" target="_blank">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Fundamentals-of-Ethical-Hacking-from-Scratch</a>). The two files that need to be changed are <kbd>lsb-release</kbd> and <kbd>os-release</kbd>. We are going to open two tabs, one for each file, and the first one is in the <kbd>/etc</kbd> directory, and it's called <kbd>lsb-release</kbd>. Before we modify the file, we are actually going to copy it and store a backup of it, because after we finish this step we are going to restore it to the way it was.</span></li>
<li>We are going to create a new folder, and we are going to call it<span> </span><kbd>backup</kbd>, and we will paste the file in the<span> </span><kbd>backup</kbd><span> </span>folder. After we do that we are going to modify the file according to the instructions. We are going to open it with Leafpad, and we are going to copy all of the content, save it, and quit. We are going to do the same with the next file, which is <kbd>os-release</kbd>, which is stored in<span> </span><kbd>/usr/lib/os-release</kbd>. We are going to copy the file and put it in our<span> </span><kbd>backup</kbd><span> </span>folder. Then we are going to modify the code as per the instructions.</li>
<li> OK, once everything is done, we are going to go back and run the installer again, and it should think that we have Kali 2 installed and proceed through the installation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="6">
<li>Scroll down, click <span class="packt_screen">Accept</span>,<span> the </span><span class="packt_screen">Next</span>, and we will see that the software thinks that we have Kali 2, so it will let us<span> proceed through the installation.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="7">
<li>Now, the port is already set to <kbd>5432</kbd><span> </span>and we are going to click on <span class="packt_screen">Next</span>:</li>

<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1175 image-border" src="assets/0d304feb-c5bb-4347-a0d3-fa5fe1774ac0.png" style="width:45.08em;height:37.42em;"/></div>
<ol start="7">
<li><span>Now, we are going to put <span class="packt_screen">First</span> <span class="packt_screen">Name</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Last Name</span>, and the <span class="packt_screen">Company</span>. It will ask us to put the port for the database that's going to be used with Nexpose:</span></li>

<ol start="8">
<li>Make sure we don't check the box that is shown in the following screenshot. We will have a lot of issues if we check this box during installation; it basically should start Nexpose once the installation is over, but we are not going to check it. We will just go to install it and then start it later when we want to use it. We are not going to check this box, make sure it's unchecked. And that's it, now it's going to install it for us:</li>
</ol>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1177 image-border" src="assets/4764da1a-f52e-4828-ba02-aaeea9692ee6.png" style="width:53.67em;height:44.75em;"/></div>
<ol start="9">
<li>OK, once the the installation is successful, as we haven't started Nexpose yet, if we go to <kbd>https://localhost:3780</kbd><span> then </span>nothing's going to work. We need to run the command first and then we can can access it. We are going to talk about that in the next section. For now, we are going to click on<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Finish</span>, and we're done:</li>

<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1178 image-border" src="assets/71a9802a-e8dc-40a9-8fd1-c6b614cecdd2.png" style="width:41.42em;height:34.58em;"/></div>
<p>Now, we're going to go back and make sure we set our files back to the way they were. Now, for those of you who haven't modified them, again skip this step; if you did modify them, then make sure to go back and set them back to the way they were.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Running Nexpose</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>OK, now that we have installed Nexpose successfully, let's see how we can run it and see what it is. We've spoken about it a lot and we went through the installation process, but we still haven't seen what the tool does. The first thing to do before we can run the tool is to make sure that the database that comes with Kali Linux is turned off, because Nexpose uses its own database. If we have both of them running on the same port, they'll conflict with each other. The first thing we're going to do is stop the <kbd>postgresql</kbd> service; make sure that we have it in our mind that every time, before we run Nexpose, we turn off our database. We do it using the same command that we used in Chapter 10, <em>Gaining Access to Computer Devices</em>. It's<span> </span><kbd>service postgresql stop</kbd>, and it will make sure that the service is stopped.</p>
<p>Now, we're going to navigate to the location where we installed Nexpose. Unless we changed the location during the installation process, it should be installed in the<span> </span><kbd>/opt/rapid7/nexpose/</kbd> directory. The file that runs the server is stored in the directory called<span> </span><kbd>nsc</kbd>, and the file that we want to run is called<span> </span><kbd>nsc.sh</kbd>. We run it just the same way we ran the installer before. As we said before, to run an executable, always use <kbd>./</kbd><span> </span>and then write the name of the executable. It's<span> </span><kbd>nsc.sh</kbd>:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1179 image-border" src="assets/c25016f4-6df6-43fc-a237-1518846dab59.png" style="width:105.50em;height:37.42em;"/></div>
<p>Running this for the first time might take some time. Just let it do its thing until it runs, and once it finishes loading the framework we'll see how we can access it and use it.</p>
<p>The tool has loaded successfully, and as you can see, it's telling us that we can navigate to it using the <kbd>https://localhost:3780</kbd><span> URL</span><span> </span><span>:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1180 image-border" src="assets/f262c4a5-c942-49e5-8650-df73cce99181.png" style="width:98.50em;height:20.25em;"/></div>
<p>What we're going to do now is launch our browser and copy the URL that it just gave us. Now it's asking us to log in. Log in using the username and password that you created when you installed the tool:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/570df380-8f65-49b5-9ed0-5b6c77f055c5.png"/></div>
<p>After logging in successfully, we can see in the following screenshot that the first thing it asks us to do is to enter the product key:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1183 image-border" src="assets/bea3d545-811b-4e6d-8652-0d3173fcb1a8.png" style="width:43.17em;height:27.25em;"/></div>
<p>Now, we know this is a free version, and when we downloaded the tool we had to fill out a form. In that form we put our email address, and then they send the product key to our email. Go to your email and get the product key and paste it. After pasting it, click on<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">ACTIVATE WITH KEY</span>. As we can see, the activation is successful. It's going to refresh now. As we can see in the following screenshot, it is just showing us information about the license. Everything is activated and we're good to go:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/cf179be1-3dde-48a2-ac76-8c9963d72c29.png"/></div>
<p>We are going to go to <span class="packt_screen">Home</span> from the left menu. We can see in the preceding screenshot that everything is empty. It is the home page of the tool. Before we start talking about what everything means, let's go ahead and add a target, and then we'll do a test and we'll see because this stuff will be filled after we do a test. The first thing we are going to do is click on<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Create</span><span> </span>and click on<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Site</span><span> </span>to add a target:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1186 image-border" src="assets/a0f54f7a-1be9-4a93-adde-c10b121b9866.png" style="width:11.00em;height:14.08em;"/></div>
<p>We are going to set the <span class="packt_screen">Name</span> to <kbd>metasploitable</kbd>:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1187 image-border" src="assets/ff9cdaae-58c5-492e-9dee-b7c384d94a61.png" style="width:95.83em;height:37.75em;"/></div>
<p>We are going to go to the<span> </span><span><strong>ASSETS</strong> </span>tab and we're going to add the target. The target can be arranged the same way we added it when we were doing the network penetration things with Zenmap. We can add a range, or we can add a specific IP. In our example, we are actually targeting the Metasploitable machine. We're going to add our target, which is<span> </span><kbd>10.0.2.4</kbd>, and we're going to add this to a group, and we'll call that<span> </span><kbd>test</kbd>, our group name:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/dc5ad3b4-a116-4b3f-a65a-ff1244eedd18.png"/></div>
<p>Now, in the<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">AUTHENTICATION </span>tab, if the target uses some sort of authentication, nobody can access the target unless they need to authenticate with some sort of a service, such as an FTP service, a web HTTP authentication, a Telnet, or an SQL server. We can pick it from the<span> </span><span><span class="packt_screen">AUTHENTICATION</span></span> tab, enter the domain, username, and password, confirm your password, and that way the framework will be able to authenticate with that service and test the security of your server. Now, our server doesn't use any type of authentication. We don't need it. Also, if we are targeting a web application that has a login page, for example for users of Facebook, then we won't have access to most of Facebook's features unless we log in using a certain username and a password. Using this feature here, we can log in and then test the security of our target.</p>
<p>The<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">TEMPLATES </span>tab is where we select the scan type. It's very similar to the scan type with Zenmap. We've seen in Zenmap we had a quick scan, quick scan plus, and intense scan. It is the same. Each one of these profiles is different. It scans different things. For example, we have the<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Full audit</span>, which takes a lot of time but pretty much checks for everything. Then we have <span class="packt_screen">Full audit enhanced logging without Web Spider</span>:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1189 image-border" src="assets/07743c1c-8f00-4a40-98dd-03481441ddf5.png" style="width:93.92em;height:45.58em;"/></div>
<p>A Web Spider is a tool or a script that finds all the files and directories in our targets. The default one is the<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Full audit without Web Spider</span>. We also have network-specific profiles, and we have web audits as well. I really encourage you to try most of them, and get familiar with them.</p>
<p>We're only going to try<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Full audit enhanced logging without Web Spider</span><span> </span>because using them is the same. We will be scanning for ICMP, TCP, and UDP ports. We are leaving it the same. We are going to leave the<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">ENGINE</span><span> </span>tab the same as well, which means it's going to use the local engine that we installed instead of using the one that is provided by Rapid7. In the<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">ALERTS</span> tab, we can set up custom alerts so that when a vulnerability is found, we get a notification. The <span class="packt_screen">SCHEDULE</span> is a really cool feature. Now, say we are working for a company or for an enterprise that keeps pushing code, new code every day, or maybe we do a test today and everything we are working on is good; our web servers, our programs, your applications, everything is up to date and there's no vulnerabilities in them. Let's say tomorrow we pushed a new vulnerable code, or maybe tomorrow someone discovers a new vulnerability with a program that we are using on our web server. We are not secure any more. This feature allows us to schedule this test so that it runs every week, or every hour, or every month, depending on how critical it is. Go into<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Create Schedule</span><span> </span>and create the schedule. We can set a<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Start Date</span>, and we can set the<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Frequency</span><span> </span>to<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Every Day</span>, every Thursday, every 26th, depending on what we want:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1217 image-border" src="assets/e4378e1a-e235-4eab-bb10-acffc3889da2.png" style="width:94.08em;height:58.42em;"/></div>
<p>We create that schedule, and then <span>the scan will run </span><span>every interval that we specify, and we can </span><span>even</span><span> </span><span>get it to produce a report for us. When we can go over the report and see what's changed, or what has been discovered.</span></p>
<p>The most important part is that we put our target in<span> the </span><span class="packt_screen">ASSETS</span><span> </span>tab. Then we select a template from<span> the </span><span class="packt_screen">TEMPLATES</span><span> </span>tab. We have both of these tabs configured, we're going to click on<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Save and Scan</span>, which will save this configuration and start a scan for us. As we can see, our asset discovery is in progress, and after that we will talk about the results that we got:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1218 image-border" src="assets/8142414b-987d-43be-a9c6-5e6f3eb81bf3.png" style="width:86.75em;height:20.67em;"/></div>

<p>Our scan is over and we are on the<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Assets</span><span> </span>page, and as we can see in the following screenshot we have one asset scanned. We can see that the asset is running<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Ubuntu</span>, and the skill that we need to hack into this asset is<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Novice</span>:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1220 image-border" src="assets/53386dd5-d744-45c6-b175-958e3f784d66.png" style="width:89.25em;height:53.92em;"/></div>
<p>From the preceding screenshot, we can see that Nexpose shows us much more information than Metasploit Community, and it's a much more advanced vulnerability management framework.</p>
<p>We can see that we scanned one target, <span class="packt_screen">METASPLOITABLE</span>, and the site is global. It's running on<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Ubuntu Linux 8.04</span>, and we discovered no malware, <span class="packt_screen">175</span><span> </span>exploits,<span> and </span><span class="packt_screen">306</span><span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Vulnerabilities</span>. Remember that with Metasploit Community we only discovered 1 exploitable vulnerability and 8 modules that can be used. Here, we discovered 306 vulnerabilities. We discovered many more vulnerabilities and exploits.</p>
<p>We can see that there is a risk factor, and the last time that the scan was done. If we scroll down, we can see the<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">OPERATING SYSTEMS</span><span> </span>that we discovered. Again, it's<span> </span><span><span class="packt_screen">Ubuntu Linux 8.04</span></span>. We can see the<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">SOFTWARE</span><span> </span>that is installed on the target computer, not only the services that's running on ports. We can see actual software installed on the target computer:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1222 image-border" src="assets/cc14a36f-3b93-4367-83c9-484a640f89f9.png" style="width:89.17em;height:48.83em;"/></div>
<p>This can be very useful after we hack the computer. After we've managed to hack into it, it's very useful to find local exploits that can be used to increase our privileges. For example, if we manage to, if we got a normal user and you wanted to become a root, then we can use a local buffer overflow to increase our privileges or to do other kinds of stuff. These are very useful in terms of post-exploitation.</p>
<p>If we go down, we'll see the<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">SERVICES</span><span> </span>that are installed on the target computer. Just like Nmap gave it to us, we can see that<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">HTTP</span><span> </span>is running,<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">DNS</span>, and so on:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1223 image-border" src="assets/166ee2e7-d5a9-4d06-a8bb-a1fdd9534d73.png" style="width:97.17em;height:36.50em;"/></div>
<p>If we click on any of these services we will see more information about them. For example, with an HTTP service, we have a description about it, and the ports that it's running on. We can see that HTTP is running on port<span> </span><kbd>80</kbd><span> </span>and on port<span> </span><kbd>8180</kbd>:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1224 image-border" src="assets/2a8b5f62-f01a-4016-8189-b05b75efe9d1.png" style="width:91.08em;height:29.50em;"/></div>
<p>Now, let's scroll up, and if we want to have a closer look at the vulnerabilities we can go to the<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Vulnerabilities</span><span> </span>page:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1225 image-border" src="assets/da6abec9-bab6-4788-9b2b-19a52233fe6e.png" style="width:87.67em;height:29.08em;"/></div>
<p>As you can can see in the preceding screenshot, we have a graph about the vulnerabilities categorized based on their risk factor on the left, and on the right they're categorized based on the skill level needed in order to exploit them. As we scroll down, we can see a list of all of vulnerabilities, and we can switch between them using the arrows:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1226 image-border" src="assets/4e69f62d-05f8-4f53-83a1-46ff84df827b.png" style="width:97.08em;height:39.42em;"/></div>
<p>Again, if there is any malware we will see it under the malware icon, and if there is an exploitation we will see under the exploit icon. Now, all of the top vulnerabilities listed don't have an exploitation using a tool, but they are ordered based on the risk. The listed <span>vulnerabilities</span><span> </span>are very risky, and as we proceed through them the risk decreases.</p>
<p>We can see in the preceding screenshot that we discovered that<span> the </span><span class="packt_screen">VNC password is "password"</span>. We can go in and try to connect using VNC. VNC is a service that's very similar to Remote Desktop. Basically, it will show us the desktop and it will allow us to gain full access to the target computer, just like Remote Desktop. It's telling us that the password for login is<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">password</span>. It's also telling us that there is a back door<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Shell Backdoor Service</span><span> </span>running, and we used that already.</p>
<p><span>Now, let's look at something that can be exploitable. We are going to click on the exploit icon to order them by the exploit, and we can see that all of these have an M logo, which means that they can be exploited using Metasploit:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1251 image-border" src="assets/9ab3e50e-0b16-424c-bff3-00788655ddcd.png" style="width:97.00em;height:41.25em;"/></div>
<p><span>As you can see in the preceding screenshot we have the <span class="packt_screen">Remote Shell Service</span> that we can use, and there is the <span class="packt_screen">Remote Login Service</span> that can be used as well, which we have already had a look at. Let's click on something that we haven't seen before, for example, <span class="packt_screen">Default Tomcat User and Password</span>. </span><span>In the following screenshot we can see a description of this vulnerability:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1252 image-border" src="assets/e8a72270-f011-41b5-b484-bd9058f32a73.png" style="width:85.25em;height:18.92em;"/></div>
<p><span>Again, we can see the port that it's running on, and you can see why it thinks that this particular target is vulnerable to this exploit:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1253 image-border" src="assets/231ad15c-fe65-40fd-a355-273621e940bb.png" style="width:89.00em;height:29.08em;"/></div>
<p><span>If we scroll down, it will show you how we can exploit it:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1254 image-border" src="assets/86925b22-98e5-4708-a49c-a595686c11ff.png" style="width:91.92em;height:23.75em;"/></div>
<p><span>There are three different modules that can be used to exploit it, but it doesn't really have to exploit it. Sometimes we just see modules that can be used to verify the existence of this exploit, but basically these are the modules associated with it. If we click on the <span class="packt_screen">Source Link</span></span> of any<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Exploit</span><span>, it will take us to the Rapid7 page that we used to see when we Googled stuff:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1255 image-border" src="assets/d83098ee-4b66-4758-ad91-aa1765619b5b.png" style="width:106.58em;height:70.83em;"/></div>
<p><span>We see the <span class="packt_screen">Module Name</span>, which we can just copy and paste into Metasploit, where we can run <kbd>show options</kbd> and then <kbd>use</kbd> the exploit the same way that we've seen it in previous chapters.</span><span> S</span><span>crolling down further reveals the <span class="packt_screen">REFERENCES</span> to the particular exploit:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1256 image-border" src="assets/37eb3cd8-e3d7-4c67-839b-14fa7658b9df.png" style="width:58.33em;height:17.00em;"/></div>
<p><span>At the bottom, it'll show us the <span class="packt_screen">REMEDIATIONS</span> on how we can fix this exploit:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1257 image-border" src="assets/3134d833-30df-43f8-957f-4e405136da52.png" style="width:64.17em;height:16.75em;"/></div>
<p><span>For this vulnerability, all we need to do is just change the administrator password and not use the default configuration.</span></p>
<p><span>Another useful thing is in the <span class="packt_screen">Reports</span> tab:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1259 image-border" src="assets/cdb1af1b-f3bc-4cd1-97a2-ebd2cb3c1d25.png" style="width:87.08em;height:41.17em;"/></div>
<p>This framework allows us to generate reports for each scan that we do, and there are different types of template for the reports. Inside <span class="packt_screen">Create a report</span>, we can see that there is an <span class="packt_screen">Audit Report</span> that contains a lot of detailed information for the programmers or for the technical people. We can use an <span class="packt_screen">Executive Report</span>, which has less information and is made for the managers or for the top-level people that don't have much experience with technical stuff. We can select any template we want <span>and name </span>it anything. We will call this report <kbd>metasploitable report</kbd>, as shown in the preceding screenshot. If we scroll a little we can select the format that we want:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1260 image-border" src="assets/a40b59f3-623b-4ac8-93ba-b999d2f36b5e.png" style="width:62.25em;height:33.92em;"/></div>
<p><span>It's set to <span class="packt_screen">PDF</span> in the preceding screenshot. Then, we are going click on <span class="packt_screen">Select Scan</span></span>,<span> select our target scan that we want to generate a report for, and select <span class="packt_screen">metasploitable</span>:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1261 image-border" src="assets/581be750-12d7-45f8-b01c-634f51aa4af9.png" style="width:91.33em;height:25.67em;"/></div>
<p><span>Then, we click on <span class="packt_screen">SAVE &amp; RUN THE REPORT</span> to generate the report:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1262 image-border" src="assets/c604bb29-ea5e-48a0-bf8a-fd9af6dc771e.png" style="width:46.42em;height:26.42em;"/></div>
<p><span>We can also generate reports automatically every time, because we can schedule reports, schedule scans, and we can also schedule an automatic report each time a scan is done. For example, if we are scanning every week, you can also generate a report every week, every time that scan's done. Now, just download the report by clicking on the report, and let's see what it looks like:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/b4d7a8b2-5c7e-4d45-929d-9bf1e0c1b9b8.png"/></div>
<p><span>As we can see in the following screenshot, it has the date, it has the title, it has all the exploits that have been found, but this is the executive report. It has small details about the exploits and more graphical stuff to show the executives the risks that have been found and how critical they are:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1273 image-border" src="assets/17843bba-7865-4eda-b62f-a31dbf43bec2.png" style="width:51.00em;height:34.08em;"/></div>
<p><span>As we can see in the preceding screenshot, Nexpose shows us much more detail and it's much more advanced. It's directed towards bigger companies, bigger infrastructures, where we need to always make sure everything is up to date, everything is installed, and there aren't any exploits.<br/></span></p>

<p><span>We have seen</span><span> how we can use the Metasploit framework, which comes preinstalled with Kali Linux. We then used this framework for various scans and also studied how to analyze the reports generated. We then installed the Nexpose tool and saw how to use it to scan the vulnerabilities and get reports in the form of graphs. We also learned how to read through it.</span></p>
<p><span>In the next chapter, we will be covering various</span><span> client-side attacks.</span></p>
