<p>This chapter focuses on the basics that we need to know before we start with web application penetration testing. We will start by learning what a website actually is, as well as giving an overview of the processing that happens on the backend when we request access to a website. Later, we will discuss ways to attack a website, and look at a few tools.</p>
<p>The following topics will be covered in this chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is a website?</li>
<li>Attacking a website</li>
</ul>

<p class="mce-root">Before we can start website penetration testing, we need to understand what a website really is. A website is just an application that is installed on a computer. The computer might have better specifications than our computer, but fundamentally, it works just like any other computer, which means that it has an operating system, as well as a number of applications that allow it to act as a web server. The <span>two</span> <span>main applications that it has are a</span> web server <span>(for example, Apache), and a</span> database (for example, MySQL):</p>
<ul>
<li class="mce-root">The <strong>web server</strong> basically understands and executes the web application. Our web application can be written in PHP, Python, or any other programming language. The only restriction is that the web server needs to be able to understand and execute the web application.</li>
<li class="mce-root">The <strong>database</strong> contains the data that is used by the web application. All of this is stored on a computer called the server. The server is connected to the internet and has an IP address; anybody can access or ping it.</li>
</ul>
<p class="mce-root">The web application is executed either by the web server—which is installed on our server—or on the target; therefore, any time we request a page or run a web application, it's actually executed on the web server and not on the client's computer. Once it is executed on the web server, the web server sends an HTML page—which is ready to read—to the target person or client, as shown in the following figure:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/fd38b878-27d6-4a50-b16c-9fce0cede976.png" style="width:33.75em;height:19.92em;"/></div>
<p class="mce-root"><span>Let's say,</span> for example, that we are using a phone or a computer and we want to access facebook.com. If we type facebook.com into our URL, it will be translated to an IP address <span>using a DNS server</span><span>. A DNS is a server that translates every name,</span> <kbd>.com</kbd><span>,</span> <kbd>.edu</kbd><span>, or any website with a name or a domain name to its relevant IP address. If we request facebook.com, the request goes to a DNS server that then translates facebook.com to the IP where Facebook is stored, and then the DNS server will go to the IP address of Facebook, execute the page that we wanted using all of the applications that we have spoken about, and then just give us a ready HTML page.</span></p>
<p class="mce-root">Now, what we get back is just a markup written in HTML—which is a markup language—of the result of executing the program; the program gets executed on the server, and we just get the result. This is very important, because in the future, if we wanted to get anything executed on the web server, such as a shell, or a virus to be executed on the target computer, then we need to send it in a language that the web server understands (for example, PHP), and once we execute it inside the server, it will be executed on the target computer.</p>
<p class="mce-root">This means that, regardless of the person that accesses the page, the web shell that we are going to send (if it is written in PHP or in a language that the server understands) will be executed on the server and not on our computer. Therefore, it will give us access to the server and not to the person who accessed that server. On the other hand, some websites use JavaScript, which is a client-side language. If we manage to find a website that allows you to run JavaScript code, then the code will be executed by the clients. Even though the code might be injected into the web server, it will be executed on the client side, and it will allow us to perform attacks on the client computer and not on the server. Hence, it's very important to distinguish between a client-side language and a server-side language.</p>

<p>In this section, we will discuss attacking a website. We have two approaches for attacking websites:</p>
<ul>
<li>We can use the methods that we've learned so far about attacking a website. Because we know a website is installed on a computer, we can try to attack and hack it just like any another computer. We can also try to use server-side attacks to see which web server, operating system, or other applications are installed, and, if we find any vulnerabilities, to see if we can use any of them to gain access to the computer.</li>
<li>Another way to attack is to use client-side attacks. Because websites are managed by humans, there must be humans managing and maintaining these websites. This means that, if we manage to hack any of the site's administrators, we will probably be able to get their username and password, and from there log in to their admin panel or to the <strong>Secure Socket Shell</strong> (<span><strong>SSH</strong>). Then we will be able to access</span> any of the services that they use to manage the website.</li>
</ul>
<p>If both of these methods fail, we can try to test the web application, because it is just an application installed on that website. Therefore, our target might not actually be the web application—maybe our target is just a person using that website, but whose computer is inaccessible. Instead, we can go to the website, hack into the website, and from there go to our target person.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>All of these <span>applications and devices</span> are interconnected, and we can use one of them to our advantage and then make our way to another place or to another computer. In this section, we won't be focusing on server and client-side attacks any further. Instead, we'll be learning about testing the security of the web application itself.</p>
<p>Our target will be a Metasploitable machine, and if we run the <kbd>ifconfig</kbd> command on Metasploitable, we will see that its IP is <kbd>10.0.2.4</kbd>, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1332 image-border" src="assets/7a4d896c-c851-49ce-8945-3df1a7490e93.png" style="width:39.50em;height:20.33em;"/></div>
<p><span>If we look inside the <kbd>/var/www</kbd> folder, we'll see all the website files stored, as shown in the following screenshot:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1333 image-border" src="assets/ee8dcb5c-62db-4194-87b4-22912d93e0e9.png" style="width:31.50em;height:3.17em;"/></div>
<p><span>In the preceding screenshot, w</span>e can see that we have our <kbd>phpinfo.php</kbd> page, and we have <kbd>mutillidae</kbd>, <kbd>dvwa</kbd>, and <kbd>phpMyAdmin</kbd>. If we go to the Kali machine, or to any machine on the same network, and try to open the browser and go to <kbd>10.0.2.4</kbd>, <span>we will see that we have a website made for Metasploitable, as shown in the following screenshot. A website is just an application installed on the web browser, and we can access any of the Metasploitable websites and use them to test their security:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1334 image-border" src="assets/52415726-1777-4728-8418-d64ef9d1534f.png" style="width:37.17em;height:32.67em;"/></div>
<p>Another thing to look at is the DVWA page. It requires a username and a password to log in; the <span class="packt_screen">Username</span> is <kbd>admin</kbd> and the <span class="packt_screen">Password</span> is <kbd>password</kbd>. Once we enter these credentials, we can log in to it, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1335 image-border" src="assets/9b97dd53-8723-48d0-a66a-ecb29ee9016f.png" style="width:106.58em;height:57.92em;"/></div>
<p>Once logged in, we can modify the security settings by using the <span class="packt_screen">DVWA Security</span> tab:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1336 image-border" src="assets/e0d12b51-5e30-4cb9-9d37-868aa758dd78.png" style="width:75.08em;height:61.25em;"/></div>
<p>Under the <span class="packt_screen">DVWA Security</span> tab, we will set <span class="packt_screen">Script Security</span> to <span class="packt_screen">low</span> and click on <span class="packt_screen">Submit</span>:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1337 image-border" src="assets/383289f0-6505-4687-98b9-4a74755b9d44.png" style="width:21.75em;height:12.50em;"/></div>
<p>We will keep it set to <span class="packt_screen">low</span> in the upcoming sections. Because this is just an introductory course, we'll only be talking about the basic ways of discovering web application vulnerabilities in both DVWA and the Mutillidae web application.</p>
<p>If we go to the Mutillidae <span>web application in</span> the same way that we accessed the DVWA web application, we should make sure that our <span class="packt_screen">Security Level</span> is set to <span class="packt_screen">0</span>, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/ab3a3abc-3c90-416d-a1c8-d334b6c6a964.png"/></div>
<p>We can toggle <span class="packt_screen">Security Level</span> by clicking the <span class="packt_screen">Toggle Security</span> option on the page:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1341 image-border" src="assets/36d51b4a-0d61-45ad-8a02-f3787e0cd8ac.png" style="width:63.42em;height:4.00em;"/></div>

<p>In this chapter, we learned about the concepts and methods that are necessary to perform website penetration testing. We began by learning about what a website is, and we gave a brief overview of how backend processing takes place when we request a particular website on our devices. Then we discussed the techniques that are used to attack a website, as well as tools such as <span>Metasploitable and DVWA.</span></p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will be focusing on information gathering and analysis, and also how to use this information to exploit the target system.</p>
