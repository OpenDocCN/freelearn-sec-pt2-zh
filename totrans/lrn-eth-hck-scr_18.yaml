    about the client using the `Whois` command, Netcraft, and Robtex. Then, we will
    see how we can attack a server by targeting websites that are hosted on that server.
    Moving toward the information gathering section, we are going to learn about subdomains
    and how they they can be useful for performing attacks. Later, we are going to
    look for files on the target system to gather some information and also analyze
    that data.

    using commands such as Whois, and tools such as Netcraft and Robtex to gather

- en: The first thing we do before we start trying to exploit or find any vulnerabilities
    is information gathering. Therefore, we try to gather as much information as possible
    about the target, and web applications are no different. We're going to start
    by trying to get as much information as we can about the target IP address, the
    domain name info, the technology that is used on the website, which programming
    language is used, what kind of server is installed on it, and what kind of database
    is being used. We're going to gather information about the company and its DNS
    records, and we'll also see if we can find any files that are not listed, or any
    subdomains that are not visible to other people. Now, we can use any of the information
    gathering tools that we used before; for example, we can use Maltego and just
    insert an entity as a website, and then start running actions. It's exactly the
    same as we did with a normal person, in [Chapter 11](ed4df884-d2d6-4c71-a1a4-28e4a508ed19.xhtml),
    *Client Side Attacks - Social Engineering*. We can also use Nmap, or even Nexpose,
    and test the infrastructure of the website and see what information we can gather
    from that. Again, we won't be going over that because we've seen it in previous
    chapters. There is no difference between a website or a normal computer—as we
    know, a website is just another computer. So, what we are going to be focusing
    on are technologies that we will only see on websites, such as domain names, DNS
    records, and stuff like that, that we either won't be able to use or haven't seen
    before in the previous chapters.

    Lookup is a protocol that's used to find the owners of internet resources, for
    example, a server, an IP address, or a domain. So, we're not actually hacking;
    we're literally just retrieving info from a database that contains information
    about owners of stuff on the internet. So, for example, when we sign up for a
    domain name, if we wanted to register a domain name, for example, za1d.com, when
    we do that, we have to supply information about the person who is signing in,
    the address, and then the domain name will be stored in our name and people will
    see that Zaid owns the domain name. That is all we're going to do.

    can understand and run PHP code. This is very important because, in the future,
    if we manage to run any kind of code on our target, then we know the code should
    be sent as PHP code. To create payloads on Metasploit or on Veil-Evasion, we should
    create them in PHP format and the target website will be able to run them because
    it supports PHP. On the Client-Side, we can see in the preceding screenshot that
    the website supports JavaScript, so if we run JavaScript, or if we manage to run
    JavaScript code on the website, it won't be executed on the website; it will be
    executed on the users side who are viewing the website, because JavaScript is
    a client-side language and PHP is server-side. If we manage to run PHP code, it
    will be executed on the server itself. If we manage to run JavaScript, it will
    be executed on the users or the peoples machine who visit the website. It's the
    same with jQuery. This is just a framework for JavaScript.

    These normal computers have IP addresses and, using the IP address, we can access
    our target website. Now, in many scenarios, our target website, or our target
    server, will contain a large number of websites, hence it'll have the website
    that we are targeting, but it will also contain other websites on the same server,
    hence on the same filesystem. For example, if we could not find any vulnerabilities
    in our target website, we can still try to hack into any other website that is
    installed on the same server. If we can do that, then we will be able to gain
    access to the server. Gaining access to the server basically means that we have
    access to all the other websites, because the server is just a computer, and we
    can navigate to the website that we want to hack and gain access to that website.
    Suppose we are trying to hack into a website and we can't find an exploit, then
    the next step will be trying to hack any other website that existing on the same
    server. Hence, what we mean by exist on the same server is they have the same

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this section we're going to study subdomains. We see subdomains everywhere,
    for example, `subdomain.target.com`. Now, if we have `beta.facebook.com`, we would
    have `mobile.facebook.com`, or we might have user.facebook.com. Suppose we google
    `mail.google.com`, which just takes us to Gmail. Why subdomains are important
    is, in a lot of cases, websites have subdomains for their own users, for example,
    for employees or for certain customers, so they're not advertised unless it's
    some sort of a VIP customer or we are an employee. We will not see these subdomains
    on search engines and we will never see a link leading to them, so they might
    contain vulnerabilities or exploits that will help us gain access to the whole
    website, but we just never knew about them because they're not advertised. Another
    thing is, a lot of the big websites, when they're trying to install a new update
    or add a new feature to the website, install it in a subdomain, so we have `beta.facebook.com`,
    which actually contains a beta version of Facebook, which contains experimental
    features. Now, experimental features are great because they're still under development,
    and there's a really high chance of finding exploits in them. This is actually
    true, not so long ago, someone was able to brute-force the restore password key
    for any Facebook user and was able to gain access to any Facebook user's account.
    This was only possible through `beta.facebook.com` because Facebook used to check
    for a number of attempts or failed attempts, and they just didn't implement that
    security feature in beta because they didn't think anyone was going to go there.
    Beta usually contains more problems than the normal website, so it is very useful
    to try and hack into it. In this section, we will see how we can find any subdomains
    that have not been advertised, or even advertised ones, so we'll be able to get

    that we cannot see. So, through the links, we will be able to access different

    are always files and directories hidden that we just never see. We''ll see how
    we can get URLs for the files and access them, and read the information in them.
    To do that, we''re going to use a tool called `dirb`, and to see how to use that
    tool we''re going to run the `man dirb` command to see all the options associated
    with that tool. In the following screenshot, we can see the syntax. To use the
    tool, we just type in `dirb`, the URL of our target, and then output a wordlist.
    The way it works is based on a brute-force attack, and just uses a wordlist of
    names and it sends requests with those names. Any time it finds something it tells
    us, then we will find a file with a name from the wordlist. So, it is only able
    to find names and directories based on the wordlist that we provide:'

- en: We can create a wordlist using `crunch` or we can use wordlists that come with
    the `dirb` tool. The options here allow us to configure how the tool works. We
    can change things around the way we want them. For example, we can disable the
    recursive nests of the tools so it just runs on one directory instead of trying
    a number of directories. We can get it to ask us if we want it to access the directory
    or not, instead of automatically accessing directories and trying to find files
    within those directories, because this could be exhaustive if our target is a
    big website; there might be a lot of directories and then the tool would try to
    access all of them and find files within all of them. We can see how big the tree
    could go. We can also set it to use a username and a password if the target websites
    use some sort of authentication, and we can use `-v` for verbose output and `-o`
    to output the results to a file.

    we''re targeting a website not an IP address. Then, we are going to put the directory,
    in our case the `mutillidae` directory, that we want to find files and directories
    within. We don''t want it to access anything within other directories, because
    we have a number of scripts installed on the Metasploitable web server; we only

    instead of the way we wrote the command, just state the path where our wordlist
    is placed. For example, let's say, if it's in the `root` directory, we type it
    as `root/wordlist.txt`, but at the moment, it's using the default one, which is
    stored in the `usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt` directory. In the next section,

    hosted on a server to exploit that particular server. We then learned about domains
    and how they can act as an important source of information that can we use to
    attack a victim. Later, we studied how to access files on a target system or target
    websites, and also how to analyze important information from various files.
