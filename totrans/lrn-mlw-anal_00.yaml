- en: The advancement of the computer and internet technology has changed our lives,
    and it has revolutionized the way the organizations conduct businesses. However,
    technology evolution and digitization has given rise to cybercriminal activities.
    The growing threat of cyberattacks on critical infrastructure, data centers, and
    private/public, defence, energy, government, and financial sectors poses a unique
    challenge for everyone from an individual to large corporations. These cyberattacks
    make use of malicious software (also known as Malware ) for financial theft, espionage,
    sabotage, intellectual property theft, and political motives.

- en: With adversaries becoming sophisticated and carrying out advanced malware attacks,
    detecting and responding to such intrusions is critical for cybersecurity professionals.
    Malware analysis has become a must-have skill for fighting advanced malware and
    targeted attacks. Malware analysis requires a well-balanced knowledge of many
    different skills and subjects. In other words, learning malware analysis demands
    time and requires patience.

    and characteristics of Windows malware using malware analysis. This book starts
    by introducing you to basic concepts of malware analysis. It then gradually progresses
    deep into more advanced concepts of code analysis and memory forensics. To help
    you understand the concepts better, various real-world malware samples, infected
    memory images, and visual diagrams are used in the examples throughout the book.
    In addition to this, enough information is given to help you understand the required
    concepts, and wherever possible, references to additional resources are provided
    for further reading.
