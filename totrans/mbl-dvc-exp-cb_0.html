We are adapting ourselves to new and improved Smartphones, gadgets, and their accessories, and with this network of smart things, comes bigger risks. Threat exposure increases and the possibility of data losses increase. Exploitations of mobile devices are significant sources of such attacks. Mobile devices come with different platforms, such as Android and iOS. Each platform has its own feature-set, programming language, and a different set of tools. This means that each platform has different exploitation tricks, different malware, and requires a unique approach in regards to forensics or penetration testing.
Device exploitation is a broad subject which is widely discussed, equally explored by both Whitehats and Blackhats. This book takes you through a wide variety of exploitation techniques across popular mobile platforms. The journey starts with an introduction to basic exploits on mobile platforms, malware analysis, and reverse engineering for Android and iOS platforms. You'll learn more about mobile devices, static and dynamic analysis, and other attacks. You'll explore mobile device forensics and learn how to attack mobile application traffic and SSL, followed by penetration testing. The book also takes you through the basic exploit tricks on BlackBerry and Windows platforms.
