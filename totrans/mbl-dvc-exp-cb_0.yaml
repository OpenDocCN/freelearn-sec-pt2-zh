- en: Mobile attacks are always on the rise. We are adapting ourselves to new and
    improved Smartphones, gadgets, and their accessories, and with this network of
    smart things, comes bigger risks. Threat exposure increases and the possibility
    of data losses increase. Exploitations of mobile devices are significant sources
    of such attacks. Mobile devices come with different platforms, such as Android
    and iOS. Each platform has its own feature-set, programming language, and a different
    set of tools. This means that each platform has different exploitation tricks,
    different malware, and requires a unique approach in regards to forensics or penetration
    testing. Device exploitation is a broad subject which is widely discussed, equally
    explored by both Whitehats and Blackhats. This book takes you through a wide variety
    of exploitation techniques across popular mobile platforms. The journey starts
    with an introduction to basic exploits on mobile platforms, malware analysis,
    and reverse engineering for Android and iOS platforms. You'll learn more about
    mobile devices, static and dynamic analysis, and other attacks. You'll explore
    mobile device forensics and learn how to attack mobile application traffic and
    SSL, followed by penetration testing. The book also takes you through the basic
    exploit tricks on BlackBerry and Windows platforms. Overall, the book takes you
    through the four common mobile platforms basic attacks with stress on Android
    and iOS.
