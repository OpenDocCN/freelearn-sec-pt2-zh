  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Cyber threats today are one of the key problems every organization faces. This
    book uses various Python libraries, such as TensorFlow, Keras, scikit-learn, and
    others, to uncover common and not-so-common challenges faced by cybersecurity
    researchers.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The book will help readers to implement intelligent solutions to existing cybersecurity
    challenges and build cutting edge implementations that cater to increasingly complex
    organizational needs. By the end of this book, you will be able to build and use
    **machine learning** (**ML**) algorithms to curb cybersecurity threats using a
    recipe-based approach.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for cybersecurity professionals and security researchers who want
    to take their skills to the next level by implementing machine learning algorithms
    and techniques to upskill computer security. This recipe-based book will also
    appeal to data scientists and machine learning developers who are now looking
    to bring in smart techniques into the cybersecurity domain. Having a working knowledge
    of Python and being familiar with the basics of cybersecurity fundamentals will
    be required.

    machine learning. You''ll also learn how to use deep learning to have a recording
    of a target saying whatever you want them to say. The chapter also runs through
    a lie detection cycle and shows you how to train a **Recurrent Neural Network**
    (**RNN**) so that it is able to generate new reviews, similar to the ones in the
    training dataset.'
