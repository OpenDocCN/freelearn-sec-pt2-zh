			<h1 id="_idParaDest-40"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor040"/>Chapter 4</em>: Open Source Ninja</h1>
			<p>This chapter will take you, the reader, through the art of Google-Fu, researching a company, facility, process, control, contract, or other form of <a id="_idTextAnchor041"/>publicly shared information. This allows you to understand how to obtain as much information pre-engagement as possible. The important part is that time and time again, employees like to publish information about their organization. Information that is not normally shared by a company can be items such as firewalls used for segmentation, endpoint protection, <strong class="bold">network access control</strong> (<strong class="bold">NAC</strong>) information, <strong class="bold">intrusion detection system</strong> (<strong class="bold">IDS</strong>) products implemented, and many more revealing strategies. However, with a drive to be ever more connected, websites such as LinkedIn can reveal what an organization may be utilizing. </p>
			<p>Now that we have gleaned some amazing details about the organization that we are going after, we can ask the question: <em class="italic">What is the side load?</em> If we know the company is Rockwell, can we create accounts on Rockwell's support network? Can we engineer tools and people to get even deeper into the organization?</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we're going to cover the following main topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Understanding Google-Fu </li>
				<li>Searching LinkedIn</li>
				<li>Experimenting with Shodan.io</li>
				<li>Investigating with <strong class="bold">Exploit Database</strong> (<strong class="bold">exploit-db</strong>)</li>
				<li>Traversing the <strong class="bold">National Vulnerability Database</strong> (<strong class="bold">NVD</strong>)</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-41"><a id="_idTextAnchor042"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>For this chapter, you will need the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A computer with browser of choice to access the websites discussed</li>
				<li>A LinkedIn account would be very beneficial for this chapter</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-42"><a id="_idTextAnchor043"/>Understanding Google-Fu </h1>
			<p>Google<a id="_idIndexMarker223"/> has to be one of the most notable search engines on the market. I personally used <strong class="bold">WebCrawler</strong> back in the <strong class="bold">Netscape</strong> days. I remember hearing that phrase <em class="italic">Did you google it?</em> for the first time in 2002 while I was fixing someone's PalmPilot. It might be a foregone conclusion that everyone reading this content has encountered the <a id="_idIndexMarker224"/>Google search engine at some point in their career. With that said, I am still going to relay some nuggets of truth: the Google search engine is a giant indexer, basically crawling the internet and documenting and historizing the data that it encounters. Now, this next statistic is purely speculative and has no quantifiable evidence; however, I am pretty confident that 99% of Google users have never really embraced the advanced features that Google has to offer.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Google dorking</strong> or <strong class="bold">Google hacking</strong> is<a id="_idIndexMarker225"/> simply a method of using Google's advanced search <a id="_idIndexMarker226"/>features to glean sensitive details from the internet. Combining and stringing together advanced search functions allows a user to quickly acquire publicly indexed information. Using these advanced features is perfectly legal; however, the question of legality is challenged when the data indexed is used to compromise and exploit the <em class="italic">owner's data</em>. This is akin to finding vulnerabilities. There is nothing illegal with discovering a bug—software today is riddled with them, hence the perpetual slew of updates that we are constantly performing. However, if the new bug is used to exploit <em class="italic">other customers that utilize the same software</em>, this is illegal. With that said, finding sensitive information using Google dorking while engaged in a <strong class="bold">penetration test</strong> (<strong class="bold">pentest</strong>) or during research efforts requires responsible disclosure. </p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Responsible disclosure<a id="_idIndexMarker227"/> is a process by which security personnel communicate discoveries found through their research to the appropriate parties involved, such as the software or hardware vendor, the<a id="_idIndexMarker228"/> company whose sensitive data has been exposed, and the local <strong class="bold">computer emergency response team</strong> (<strong class="bold">CERT</strong>).</p>
			<p>With that disclaimer out of the way, let's proceed further. Here is a link to the <strong class="bold">Google Hacking Database</strong> (<strong class="bold">GHDB</strong>), which <a id="_idIndexMarker229"/>documents many uses of the advanced functions that can be used: <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database">https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database</a>.</p>
			<p>This is what the site will look like once you navigate to it:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer154" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_4.01_B16321.jpg" alt="Figure 4.1 – GHDB&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.1 – GHDB</p>
			<p>Here is a short list of advanced functions<a id="_idIndexMarker230"/> for Google dorking. There are many more that can be found in the preceding link, but I don't want to get lost down a proverbial rabbit hole: </p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">site</strong>: (search only in the site provided)</li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">inurl</strong>: (search for a keyword in the <strong class="bold">Uniform Resource Locator</strong> (<strong class="bold">URL</strong>) provided)</li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">intitle</strong>: (search for a keyword in the title of the web page)</li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">intext</strong>: (search for a keyword in the body of the web page)</li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">filetype</strong>: (search for files with a keyword provided)</li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">ext</strong>: (search for files with a keyword provided)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These functions can be run in the<a id="_idIndexMarker231"/> Google browser to focus on information pertaining to your client. For example, you could run a search as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer155" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_4.02_B16321.jpg" alt="Figure 4.2 – Advanced search&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.2 – Advanced search</p>
			<p>This will search the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/">https://www.cdc.gov/</a> site for any public-facing <strong class="bold">File Transfer Protocol</strong> (<strong class="bold">FTP</strong>) servers that may be accessible. This is a very simple example that helps demonstrate the capabilities of the advanced functions the Google search engine has to offer. Other services and hosted file shares can be searched for, such as the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning</strong> (<strong class="bold">WebDAV</strong>): <strong class="source-inline">intitle:"Directory Listing For /" + inurl:webdav tomcat</strong> </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Structured Query Language</strong> (<strong class="bold">SQL</strong>): <strong class="source-inline">intitle: "index of" "admin/sql/"</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">VTScada</strong>: <strong class="source-inline">intitle:'VTScada Anywhere Client'</strong></li>
			</ul>
			<p>A more complex function would be something similar to the one shown here:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer156" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_4.03_B16321.jpg" alt="Figure 4.3 – Complex function&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.3 – Complex function</p>
			<p>You will see a list of Rockwell <strong class="bold">programmable logic controllers</strong> (<strong class="bold">PLCs</strong>) and their web access interface that has been exposed <a id="_idIndexMarker232"/>directly to the internet. Reviewing the command shown in <em class="italic">Figure 4.3</em>, you see that we are looking for the term <strong class="source-inline">Rockwell Automation</strong> in the <strong class="source-inline">index.html</strong> title in the URL, and finally, the specific term <strong class="source-inline">Device Name</strong>. Many devices can be discovered this way. </p>
			<p>Using standard queries and these advanced functions, you can start to build a profile of your client. Building a profile is a key step in a pentesting engagement as it allows deeper insight into your customer's infrastructure, which can be useful for harvesting information to result in a successful outcome with regard to your engagement. Start with the company name and determine which industry this <a id="_idIndexMarker233"/>customer operates in. This is important, as some <strong class="bold">Industrial Control System</strong> (<strong class="bold">ICS</strong>) vendors have a strong foothold in very specific industries.  A prime example would be <strong class="bold">Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories</strong> (<strong class="bold">SEL</strong>), who <a id="_idIndexMarker234"/>have products that can address almost all types of industries; however, you will find them primarily in the energy sector. If you happen to be in an engagement with an energy producer, transmission, or distribution customer, you can be assured that you will come across SEL technology. This is one example of a technology bound to an industry but many other examples exist, and they are easy to find by utilizing the search features we covered before.</p>
			<p>In this section, we touched on the power of Google's advanced search features and the details that can be captured from writing very focused queries. We can use the data discovered to shape customer profiles prior to even stepping foot into a meeting. In the next section, we are going to review the people component and look at effective ways of using LinkedIn.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-43"><a id="_idTextAnchor044"/>Searching LinkedIn </h1>
			<p>LinkedIn has to <a id="_idIndexMarker235"/>be the largest professional social media networking site. There are 740+ million total users on the platform. 55 million companies are listed on LinkedIn according to their listed statistics, which can be found at the following link: <a href="https://news.linkedin.com/about-us#Statistics">https://news.linkedin.com/about-us#Statistics</a>.</p>
			<p>Chances are that because of the many users and companies on the platform, we are bound to find some nuggets of gold when it comes to a pentesting engagement. Since the site is basically a real-time virtual resume for professional individuals, a mass amount of information for the user is stored in easily searchable text. Data points relating to the size of a company, the industry in which the company participates, technology used by the company, and people employed by the company are all readily available through the search input.</p>
			<p>Searching LinkedIn has the granularity to narrow in on the following details:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>People</li>
				<li>Jobs</li>
				<li>Companies</li>
				<li>Groups</li>
				<li>Schools</li>
				<li>Posts</li>
				<li>Events</li>
			</ul>
			<p>When you search a<a id="_idIndexMarker236"/> customer's company, the results will relate to the relative size of the company, as with the company shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer157" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_4.04_B16321.jpg" alt="Figure 4.4 – Company search&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.4 – Company search</p>
			<p>From this, we know where employees live and where they studied. We have the ability to search for employees by title, keyword, or school inside the sub-search input. Now, for the observant few, you may have noticed a bug already! LinkedIn indicates that there are 24,887 employees and also notes that 25,042 of them live in the <strong class="bold">United States</strong> (<strong class="bold">US</strong>). <strong class="bold">Artificial intelligence</strong> (<strong class="bold">AI</strong>) will take over the world one day, but not yet, my friends. We can start to narrow in on our search by looking for general keywords. Starting with <strong class="bold">supervisory control and data acquisition  (SCADA)</strong>, we<a id="_idIndexMarker237"/> get 476 employees with SCADA listed in their profiles, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer158" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_4.05_B16321.jpg" alt="Figure 4.5 – SCADA sub search&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.5 – SCADA sub search</p>
			<p>Running a specific search for a skillset keyword, such as <strong class="bold">telvent</strong>, will help narrow in on the systems used by this sample company and the people who may have credentials on these systems. You can see the returned results in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer159" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_4.06_B16321.jpg" alt="Figure 4.6 – Telvent skillset&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.6 – Telvent skillset</p>
			<p>When you narrow<a id="_idIndexMarker238"/> in on a subset of individuals and research their current position and details around the workplace's accomplishments, you can find many interesting and concrete details such as those shown in the following screenshot, where the company name has been redacted out of courtesy:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer160" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_4.07_B16321.jpg" alt="Figure 4.7 – Public information on systems&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.7 – Public information on systems</p>
			<p>As you can see, in this section, it is quite easy to build a more holistic profile of a company by using LinkedIn to fill in the blanks. The search feature in LinkedIn allows us to build a list of employees and positions, narrow in on the technology that the company uses, and finally build a short list of possible credential accounts as to who may have access to <a id="_idIndexMarker239"/>this technology (as seen in the previous screenshot). In order to build displays, the user requires an account on <strong class="bold">Telvent-DMS</strong> (<strong class="bold">Distribution Management System</strong>) and <strong class="bold">SCADA-EMS</strong> (<strong class="bold">Energy Management System</strong>). Leveraging<a id="_idIndexMarker240"/> this readily available data is crucial for any successful engagement. In the next section, we will be exploring Shodan.io and will examine how the insights that we can gather from <a id="_idIndexMarker241"/>using this search engine with help round out the technology that is readily accessible.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-44"><a id="_idTextAnchor045"/>Experimenting with Shodan.io </h1>
			<p>As claimed by their home page, "<em class="italic">Shodan is the world's first search engine for internet-connected devices</em>." In the last two sections, we used different search tactics to gain a free insight into how an<a id="_idIndexMarker242"/> organization is structured and organized and how to expose any services that might be open to the public. This allowed us to build a profile for our customer relating to the industry they are operating in, the individuals who are <a id="_idIndexMarker243"/>employed by them, and—if we are lucky—some of the technologies they are using. In this section, we are going to dive deeper into the services and technology by using Shodan.io.</p>
			<p>If you navigate to<a href="https://www.shodan.io/"> the<span id="_idIndexMarker244"/> following link, </a><a href="https://www.shodan.io/"/>, you will see the search engine window, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer161" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_4.08_B16321.jpg" alt="Figure 4.8 – Shodan.io search engine&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.8 – Shodan.io search engine</p>
			<p>Clicking on the <strong class="bold">Explore</strong> button will take us to the following screen:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer162" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_4.09_B16321.jpg" alt="Figure 4.9 – Exploring Shodan.io&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.9 – Exploring Shodan.io</p>
			<p>Next, we want to click on <a id="_idIndexMarker245"/>the top category, <strong class="bold">Industrial Control Systems</strong>, and you will be taken to a page that looks like this:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer163" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_4.10_B16321.jpg" alt="Figure 4.10 – Industrial Control Systems&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.10 – Industrial Control Systems</p>
			<p>If you scroll down the page, you will notice that the systems are documented by a protocol discovered by the search engine. These protocols are public-facing, as shown here:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer164" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_4.11_B16321.jpg" alt="Figure 4.11 – Public-facing protocols &#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.11 – Public-facing protocols </p>
			<p>Now, we did skip ahead to <a id="_idIndexMarker246"/>look specifically at the <strong class="bold">Industrial Control Systems</strong> section, but if this were a real engagement, you would have wanted to search the company name to see if any "low-hanging items" were present. Also, I would advise you to get into the habit of looking for corporate <strong class="bold">Internet Protocol</strong> (<strong class="bold">IP</strong>) ranges in the search input on the landing page.  </p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Story time</p>
			<p class="callout">The reason I say this is that during an engagement, I had just arrived at the head office of a customer. My team was already inside, so I quickly tethered my laptop to my cell phone and did a simple Shodan lookup of the<a id="_idIndexMarker247"/> IP range for the customer and discovered a <strong class="bold">Citrix virtual private network</strong> (<strong class="bold">VPN</strong>) <strong class="bold">access portal</strong>. Using my cell phone, I called reception and socially engineered credentials to get access to the VPN portal. I quickly logged in and realized that a simple "kiosk break" could be used and that the entire portal was running as domain admin on a domain controller. Needless to say, the 2-week engagement went quite smoothly.</p>
			<p>Now, disclaimer time once again.  Clicking on any of the protocols' <strong class="bold">Explore</strong> buttons is completely harmless, and reviewing the information that is shared on the screen is OK as well. Traversing to the IP address discovered gets into a very gray zone, as what may be publicly available shouldn't be. Though it is rare these days to find a complete operator console on Shodan, it's not impossible. If<a id="_idIndexMarker248"/> you come across a gas pipeline SCADA system, you are definitely in the realm of being liable if, all of a sudden, a compressor station shuts down or a mainline block valve closes. Remember the <a id="_idIndexMarker249"/>SCADA system that we discovered from the <strong class="source-inline">GE-XA21</strong> LinkedIn user? It uses <strong class="bold">Distributed Network Protocol 3</strong> (<strong class="bold">DNP3</strong>) for <a id="_idIndexMarker250"/>communication, along with various other protocols. If you look at the <strong class="bold">Protocols</strong> section, you will see the <strong class="bold">DNP3</strong> button. Click it, and you will be brought to the following screen:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer165" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_4.12_B16321.jpg" alt="Figure 4.12 – DNP3 discovered&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.12 – DNP3 discovered</p>
			<p>As you navigate around, you will see that there are lots of options for filtering and searching. You can filter by country, city, organization, equipment, service, port, and much more. Out of curiosity, let's search for the <strong class="bold">Koyo CLICK</strong> PLC that we set up in our lab and see the results, as follows:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer166" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_4.13_B16321.jpg" alt="Figure 4.13 – Koyo CLICK&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.13 – Koyo CLICK</p>
			<p>As you can see, Shodan <a id="_idIndexMarker251"/>has crawled Koyo CLICK devices that are freely open to the internet.  </p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">I emphasize, as a blue teamer, that you consistently and routinely check Shodan.io for your organization's IP space and technology. This will help you stay ahead of any unsightly breaches, and forces pentesters to work harder during their engagement.</p>
			<p>In this section, we briefly touched on the power of using Shodan.io and finding industrial technology that is exposed to the internet. Using Shodan.io during a pentesting engagement is a must, as you may find interesting customer equipment and/or services sitting online. By now, during a normal engagement, you will have a well-rounded profile assembled for your customer. You will have companies, industries, technologies, and people associated with your customer. In the next section, we will be reviewing <strong class="source-inline">exploit-db</strong>, which we quickly touched on with Google hacking, but we will be going deeper into details of how to associate technology with discovered and documented exploits.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-45"><a id="_idTextAnchor046"/>Investigating with ExploitDB</h1>
			<p>ExploitDB is<a id="_idIndexMarker252"/> a giant archive of shared discoveries pertaining to software flaws, exploits, and vulnerabilities. It allows for a community of security researchers and pentesters to share known compromises in an easily searchable format. Navigating to <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com">https://www.exploit-db.com</a>, you <a id="_idIndexMarker253"/>will land on the home page and be presented with the latest documented vulnerabilities discovered, as seen in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer167" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_4.14_B16321.jpg" alt="Figure 4.14 – ExploitDB&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.14 – ExploitDB</p>
			<p>If you notice, on the right-hand side we have a search input field. Type <strong class="source-inline">SCADA</strong> and press <em class="italic">Enter</em>. At the time of the printing of this book, you will see 50 vulnerabilities related to various SCADA systems, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer168" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_4.15_B16321.jpg" alt="Figure 4.15 – SCADA vulnerabilities&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.15 – SCADA vulnerabilities</p>
			<p>As you can see on<a id="_idIndexMarker254"/> the screen, we have eight headings, which are outlined as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Date</strong>: This is the date that the vulnerability was added to ExploitDB.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Download</strong>: This is the code that you can download to carry out the exploit.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">App</strong>: This is a copy of the vulnerable app that the exploit works against.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Verified</strong>: This is an approval notice indicating that the exploit is verified to work.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Title</strong>: Description of exploit.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Type</strong>: Type of exploit.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Platform</strong>: System that the exploit works against.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Author</strong>: This is the author of the exploit code.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>For many vulnerabilities, authors have included code that allows you to quickly review and augment your environment. This technique of reviewing code structure for <strong class="bold">proof-of-concept</strong> (<strong class="bold">POC</strong>) work will be covered in more depth in a later chapter, but for now, just know that you can find access to various code that will help you achieve a foothold in your clients' technology stack. We are going to take a closer look at a simple vulnerability. If we look at the following screenshot, you will see that <strong class="bold">Rockwell SCADA</strong> has a listed exploit from 2018:</p>
			<p class="figure-caption"> </p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.17 – Rockwell SCADA exploit</p>
			<p>If you <a id="_idIndexMarker255"/>notice, <strong class="bold">CVE</strong> (which stands for <strong class="bold">Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures</strong>) is labeled as <strong class="source-inline">2016-2279</strong>, meaning this vulnerability dates back to 2016—or at least that it was reported in 2016—but <a id="_idIndexMarker256"/>doesn't necessarily mean that it was discovered in 2016; it may have been found at an earlier date. As you can see, the various versions that this exploit effects are documented, and at the very end of the script is a simple <strong class="source-inline">PoC</strong> example, which means that from the <strong class="bold">graphical user interface</strong> (<strong class="bold">GUI</strong>) we can run simple <strong class="bold">cross-site scripting</strong> (<strong class="bold">XSS</strong>) to hijack a user's session or steal sensitive system information, but we will discuss more on this later. We know now that we can search <strong class="source-inline">exploit-db</strong> for any known vulnerabilities and related code that takes advantage of these flaws. This can all be done pre-engagement. In the next section, I want to quickly look at the NVD to understand the origin and driver of the exploit code found in <strong class="source-inline">exploit-db</strong>.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-46"><a id="_idTextAnchor047"/>Traversing the NVD</h1>
			<p>The NVD is the<a id="_idIndexMarker257"/> largest consortium of recorded vulnerabilities in the open source space. Navigating to <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search</a> will bring you to the following screen:</p>

			<p>There is a lot of <a id="_idIndexMarker259"/>information gathered and displayed here. Most notable are the systems affected and the risk score attached to them. Reviewing this data is important, as you will understand the depth and breadth of impact of discovering these controllers and the version of them operating in the customer environment. To look at something a bit more relevant, go back to the main screen and run a query against <strong class="bold">Rockwell technology</strong>. You should see the following vulnerabilities: </p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.21 – Rockwell vulnerabilities</p>
			<p>Here, you can see <a id="_idIndexMarker260"/>that there are 94 records found relating to Rockwell. The last published date was <strong class="bold">March 03, 2021</strong> and the record has a CVE ID of <strong class="source-inline">CVE-2021-22681</strong>. Reviewing this vulnerability, you can see it is ranked <strong class="bold">CRITICAL</strong>—and rightfully so, as it indicates that an unauthenticated attacker could bypass authentication and directly make changes on the controller. This is scary as an attacker could change set points on a process, leading to unscheduled downtime, loss of control, or even process failure. This is good news for a pentester as it provides a launching point for access to critical infrastructure.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Disclaimer</p>
			<p class="callout">Finding a vulnerability at a process-control level that has physical access to <strong class="bold">input/output</strong> (<strong class="bold">I/O</strong>) should be documented and not acted upon unless you know the exact outcome of exploiting a known vulnerability as things have a tendency to go dark or boom, all possible outcomes that can be very scary.</p>
			<p>In this section, we discovered what the<a id="_idIndexMarker261"/> NVD is and where we can find more knowledge around known vulnerabilities that have been documented. This is key, as we can build supporting evidence on our assessment report and use the documented vulnerabilities to gain access to our customers' infrastructure.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-47"><a id="_idTextAnchor048"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we covered a number of <strong class="bold">open source intelligence</strong> (<strong class="bold">OSINT</strong>) topics, specifically focusing on the ICS space. We looked at Google-Fu and how we research our customer to discover industry details and possible users. To dig deeper, we turned to LinkedIn to see if any of the employees listed on it published sensitive information in relation to their employer and the technology being used.  </p>
			<p>Next, we looked at Shodan.io for technology that is sitting on publicly accessible networks and to see if this technology belongs to our customer. After that, we moved over to ExploitDB to see if there is any publicly provided code that exploits vulnerabilities on the technology that we discovered in the previous steps. Finally, we looked directly at the NVD to see which vulnerabilities exist on systems that we gathered. With this information collected and documented, we have a well-rounded understanding of our customers' industries, people, processes, and technologies.  </p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will learn about the importance of spanning and capturing traffic that we can leverage to discover which real devices are communicating on a network.</p>
