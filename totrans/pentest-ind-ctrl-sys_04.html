			<p>In the previous chapter, we covered the importance of using open source research to build a profile of your client, their company, users, and technology. In this chapter, we are going to dive deeper down the rabbit hole and discuss out-of-band network monitoring. For the last few years, <strong class="bold">intrusion detection systems</strong> (<strong class="bold">IDS</strong>) have been dominating the industrial cybersecurity space.  </p>
			<p>Companies such as Security Matters (acquired by ForeScout), Indegy (bought by Tenable), Sentryo (bought by Cisco), CyberX (bought by Microsoft), Claroty, Nozomi Networks, SCADAfence, and many others have flourished. Money from <strong class="bold">venture capital</strong> (<strong class="bold">VC</strong>) and <strong class="bold">investment banking</strong> (<strong class="bold">IB</strong>) has been poured into the passive monitoring space to provide awareness about the importance of automation technology, and the impact it has on critical infrastructure has grown as well. </p>
			<p>All this technology relies on the network infrastructure to be able to either use a <strong class="bold">Switch Port Analyzer</strong> (<strong class="bold">SPAN</strong>) or <strong class="bold">Test Access Point</strong> (<strong class="bold">TAP</strong>) on the traffic and send it to the IDS technology. It is imperative to understand how to perform out-of-band monitoring using the aforementioned methods, and understand what this means during your pentest if your customer has invested in a particular IDS vendor. </p>
			<p>As we move through this chapter, we are going to review what SPAN is and how to mirror traffic to a port, what a TAP is and how we can utilize it in a pentesting engagement, and discuss the various IDS technologies that utilize SPAN in the industrial space and what to expect when you encounter them.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we're going to cover the following main topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Installing Wireshark </li>
				<li>What is SPAN and how can we configure it</li>
				<li>Using a TAP during an engagement</li>
				<li>Navigating IDS security monitoring</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-49"><a id="_idTextAnchor050"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>For this chapter, you will need the following:</p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-50"><a id="_idTextAnchor051"/>Installing Wireshark</h1>
			<p>After some soulful debate, I decided to move this section to the beginning of this chapter. I had planned it to be in the following chapter, but after reviewing this, I felt that it flowed <a id="_idIndexMarker262"/>nicely with the plans ahead. That being said, let's jump right into it. Wireshark is the de facto tool that's used by network engineers and security personnel alike to monitor all the bits of data moving through the network. When an issue arises, the first thing the individual or team does is open their laptop and start up Wireshark. I cannot emphasize this enough; Wireshark is fundamentally one of the most important tools that is used by the security industry and ironically, people seldom qualify it as a security tool. Wireshark is an absolute must for the proverbial tool bag that you are assembling for a pentesting engagement.</p>
			<p>Go to <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/#download">https://www.wireshark.org/#download</a> to be taken to Wireshark's stable release section. At the time of writing, this stable release is version 3.4.4 and was released March 10, 2021. Now, for some of the "Terminal junkies," "CLI connoisseurs," and "shell samurais" out there, or even those that may be using "Brew" on an Apple laptop or Linux distro, the following commands are for you.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-51"><a id="_idTextAnchor052"/>macOS</h2>
			<p>You can <a id="_idIndexMarker263"/>install Wireshark <a id="_idIndexMarker264"/>with Brew like so:</p>
			<p class="source-code">brew install wireshark</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-52"><a id="_idTextAnchor053"/>Linux distros</h2>
			<p>You can <a id="_idIndexMarker265"/>install Wireshark <a id="_idIndexMarker266"/>with <strong class="source-inline">apt-get</strong> like so:</p>
			<p class="source-code">sudo apt-get install wireshark</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-53"><a id="_idTextAnchor054"/>Windows 10</h2>
			<p>I am <a id="_idIndexMarker267"/>simply going to leave you with this link: <a href="https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Wireshark/Install">https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Wireshark/Install</a>.</p>
			<p>The installation <a id="_idIndexMarker268"/>is straightforward and there are lots of YouTube videos, wikis, blogs, and forums that you can reference.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">During your installation, you will want to ensure that you install additional or complementary components. This is where TShark, dissector plugins, Editcap, Mergecap, and other key components come into play. As we move through the next few chapters, we'll touch on a number of these items.</p>
			<p>Once you have installed Wireshark, open the program by double-clicking the desktop icon and make sure you can see all your network interfaces, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer176" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_5.01_B16321.jpg" alt="Figure 5.1 – Wireshark capture interfaces&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.1 – Wireshark capture interfaces</p>
			<p>Here, you will be able to pick an interface and start to listen to the traffic on the network. The key here is that the only network traffic you will see is broadcast, multicast, and unicast traffic that's directly related to that interface. If you were to select your <a id="_idIndexMarker269"/>Wi-Fi interface, for example, you would <a id="_idIndexMarker270"/>see lots of devices communicating on the network via multicast and broadcast communication, especially if you are like <a id="_idIndexMarker271"/>me and embrace the <strong class="bold">Internet of Things</strong> (<strong class="bold">IoT</strong>). I am making a special note of this as it leads into the next section, where we will look at more interesting data. By this, I mean data provided by unicast communication between specific devices. You must have access to a SPAN/mirror port or have installed a TAP between the devices communicating. </p>
			<p>In this section, we learned how to install Wireshark using different methods, depending on our operating system. We made sure that we saw a list of network interfaces that we could utilize to capture traffic. Finally, we noted that the information that's gathered by simply listening to a network port is not a complete and detailed picture. We require access to SPAN or a TAP to see true device-to-device unicast communication. In the next section, we will discuss what SPAN/mirroring is and learn how to configure this functionality on a simple managed switch.  </p>
			<p>What is SPAN and how can we configure it?</p>
			<p>In the previous section, we quickly installed Wireshark as a means to capture network traffic. We can now use Wireshark to verify our results. We will be able to do this once we've configured a simple SPAN/mirror port in this section. So, what is SPAN and what does it do? SPAN allows a <a id="_idIndexMarker272"/>user to duplicate all traffic on one or more ports on a managed switch, that supports SPAN/mirroring, to one or more ports on the same switch. This is commonly referred to as local SPAN. This is the primary method that is used to feed data to an IDS. There are extensions of SPAN called <strong class="bold">Remote SPAN</strong> (<strong class="bold">RSPAN</strong>) and <strong class="bold">Encapsulated Remote SPAN</strong> (<strong class="bold">ERSPAN</strong>). </p>
			<p>RSPAN allows <a id="_idIndexMarker273"/>the user to associate remote network traffic with <a id="_idIndexMarker274"/>a dedicated VLAN and then trunk that data into an additional switch. This comes at a cost, however, as you start to dedicate switch ports to RSPAN traffic. You can no longer use those specific ports for normal traffic, thus reducing the number of ports that can be utilized for operational switching. However, utilizing RSPAN is very useful for monitoring data moving through the network during a pentest, since key information can be captured and used to breach the system. Credential data, operating systems, ports and services, and other useful information is passed across the network and directly into your machine via SPAN and captured with Wireshark, TShark, or Tcpdump.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Using local SPAN or RSPAN causes the switch to increase load. If the switch is under heavy load, which means there's lots of traffic moving through the switch, using SPAN could cause packet loss and other unwanted behavior, such as production disruption. Loss of revenue due to downtime caused by an overloaded switch that starts to drop packets is the worst possible outcome during an engagement. So, be warned when performing this on switches that you don't fully control or understand.</p>
			<p>Note that the terms SPAN and port mirroring are interchangeable as they ultimately mean the same thing. So, if you were asking yourself why I was writing SPAN/mirror, it's because they mean the same thing essentially and SPAN is really a Cisco-centric term. The switch mentioned in the <em class="italic">Technical requirements</em> section – the TP-Link TL-SG108E Smart Switch – utilizes port mirroring. A typical setup or architecture for a local SPAN is shown in the following diagram:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer177" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_5.02_B16321.jpg" alt="Figure 5.2 – SPAN traffic&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.2 – SPAN traffic</p>
			<p>You can use any number of switches to test this setup. We are going to check the port settings; in the <a id="_idIndexMarker275"/>following screenshot, you can see that <a id="_idIndexMarker276"/>this switch is a simple eight-port switch. Four ports are being utilized – three operating at 1 GHz and one operating at 100 MB:</p>
			<p class="figure-caption"> </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer178" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_5.03_B16321.jpg" alt="Figure 5.3 – Port Setting screen&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.3 – Port Setting screen</p>
			<p>Seeing that one port is negotiating at a lower speed, it is safe to say that PLC communication <a id="_idIndexMarker277"/>is on that port, with the port being port 2. Granted I know this because I set up the lab, but during a real pentest, if you happen <a id="_idIndexMarker278"/>to get this level of access, it is safe to assume that lower speeds are due to industrial hardware communication. </p>
			<p>After reviewing our port settings on the switch, we have a clear idea of what port is being used for the PLC, as well as what ports are open to be used to mirror the communication back to our host. Next, we will want to set up port mirroring. Select the <strong class="bold">Monitoring</strong> option from the menu on the left and then select <strong class="bold">Port Mirror</strong>. You will be taken to the following screen:</p>
			<p class="figure-caption"> </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer179" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_5.04_B16321.jpg" alt="Figure 5.4 – Port Mirror screen&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.4 – Port Mirror screen</p>
			<p>From here, I am <a id="_idIndexMarker279"/>going to choose <strong class="bold">Enable</strong> for the <strong class="bold">Port Mirror</strong> feature <a id="_idIndexMarker280"/>and select <strong class="bold">Mirroring Port</strong>, which will be <strong class="bold">Port 1</strong>, and click the <strong class="bold">Apply</strong> button, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer180" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_5.05_B16321.jpg" alt="Figure 5.5 – Enable Port Mirror&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.5 – Enable Port Mirror</p>
			<p>Next, we want to select the port that we want to monitor. As we discovered from reviewing the port settings, port 2 has the PLC connected to it. So, click on <strong class="bold">Port 2</strong> and enable both <strong class="bold">Ingress</strong> traffic and <strong class="bold">Egress</strong> traffic, as shown here:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer181" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_5.06_B16321.jpg" alt="Figure 5.6 – Port 2 mirrored&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.6 – Port 2 mirrored</p>
			<p>If everything has worked according to the previous steps, the table will indicate that <strong class="bold">Port2</strong> has been enabled for both <strong class="bold">Ingress</strong> and <strong class="bold">Egress</strong> traffic, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer182" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_5.07_B16321.jpg" alt="Figure 5.7 – Confirm Port 2 mirror&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.7 – Confirm Port 2 mirror</p>
			<p>If you are <a id="_idIndexMarker281"/>following along and were able to get your hands on a Koyo Click, then proceed and open the CLICK Programming Software that <a id="_idIndexMarker282"/>we installed in <a href="B16321_02_Epub_AM.xhtml#_idTextAnchor027"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Route the Hardware</em>, on the Windows 7 host and connect to your PLC. If you are using a different vendor, such as Rockwell, make sure you open Studio 5000 or RSLogix and connect to your hardware. This communication between the engineering software and the PLC will create traffic across port 2 on our switch. This is exactly what we want, since duplicated packets are being mirrored to port 1. Connect a cable between port 1 and your host machine.</p>
			<p>On your host <a id="_idIndexMarker283"/>machine, open Wireshark and select the interface that you want to monitor. In my case, I have a <strong class="bold">Thunderbolt</strong> adapter on my Mac and I am using the interface labeled <strong class="source-inline">en6</strong>, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer183" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.8 – Interface selection</p>
			<p>Once selected, you will see the communication between the engineering software and the PLC, as shown in the following screenshot: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer184" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.9 – Wireshark</p>
			<p>Deep diving into Wireshark logs is outside the scope of this book, but we will briefly touch on a few key aspects in the next couple of chapters. Click on any packet and review the source and destination. If everything has been set up correctly, you will see the MAC address resolve to <strong class="source-inline">KoyoElec_##:##:##</strong>.</p>
			<p>Wireshark is <a id="_idIndexMarker284"/>just one way of examining traffic on the <a id="_idIndexMarker285"/>network graphically. If you want to review the same data from the Terminal, you can use Tcpdump. Open a Terminal and find your interface that is connected to port 2. Type in the following command:</p>
			<p class="source-code">tcpdump -i &lt;interface&gt; -v -X</p>
			<p>Tcpdump is the application that will capture the mirrored traffic. <strong class="source-inline">i</strong> in the command allows you to select the interface that you would like to listen to. In my case, this is the <strong class="source-inline">en6</strong> interface. The <strong class="source-inline">v</strong> command tells Tcpdump to display verbose data. Finally, <strong class="source-inline">X</strong> displays headers and data from each packet in hexadecimal and ASCII, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer185" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_5.10_B16321.jpg" alt="Figure 5.10 – Tcpdump command&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.10 – Tcpdump command</p>
			<p>The output from Tcpdump should match the same capture that was seen using Wireshark. Compare the two to make sure that you are seeing the same information.  This capture is shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer186" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_5.11_B16321.jpg" alt="Figure 5.11 – Tcpdump output&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.11 – Tcpdump output</p>
			<p>At this point, you are probably wondering, <em class="italic">how does this apply to me and my pentesting future?</em> Understandably, it would be very odd to gain access to a switch console and just spend time setting up a SPAN session since many other interesting things can be <a id="_idIndexMarker286"/>done at that level of access. I am simply <a id="_idIndexMarker287"/>covering the core building blocks that IDS use to absorb data. This is very important since in the last 5 or so years there has been an explosion in the adoption of passive monitoring in the industrial automation space. You will encounter IDS solutions in some form or another, and it is key to understand how they work and function. We will cover this in greater detail later in this chapter.</p>
			<p>In this section, we covered the importance of understanding what SPAN/port mirroring is and the technology that it enables. We walked through configuring a mirror port and using both Wireshark and Tcpdump to review and capture the traffic between the Koyo CLICK PLC and the engineering software. In the next section, we are going to discuss what a TAP is and how it compares to SPANing traffic. We will also discuss how TAPs are invaluable in terms of pentesting when you have physical access to your customer's infrastructure.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-54"><a id="_idTextAnchor055"/>Using a TAP during an engagement</h1>
			<p>In the previous section, we discussed what SPAN is and how to configure and use it. In this section, we are going to review what a TAP is, the different types of TAPs, and how they can be <a id="_idIndexMarker288"/>used in an engagement. Typically, TAPs are hardware devices that are inserted between two communication links so that we can perform full packet replication. TAPs can duplicate traffic to a single destination, or multiple destinations, which is called <strong class="bold">regeneration</strong>, or the TAP can provide consolidated traffic, which is referred to as aggregation.  </p>
			<p>There are a number <a id="_idIndexMarker289"/>of differences between TAPs and SPANs, but the most important in my mind is that SPAN is not a true passive solution as it creates overhead on the switch. That being said, TAPs produce a complete copy of the traffic, without this impacting the performance of the switch and knocking it over. The downside is that for you to gain access to the packets, you must do a cable swap, which could cause temporary disruption in the service. </p>
			<p>There are two primary types of TAPs – active and passive. Passive taps have no physical disconnect between interfaces, which allows communication to be maintained even if the TAP fails. Active TAPs, on the other hand, use power to duplicate communication between the interfaces, allowing it to operate at 1,000 M, whereas passive TAPs support 10/100 M networks. Using a passive TAP on gigabit networks will cause the network to degrade and produce performance issues. As you may recall, in the previous section, we saw that the PLC communication was operating at 100 M by default. This allows us to use a passive TAP in an engagement without us having to worry about causing performance issues, but once again, I have to emphasize that you should really know what the network is doing prior to installing an implant into the network. This is a cautionary tale as I have definitely knocked over critical networks in the past during pentests. In our lab environment, you don't have to worry about taking anything critical out of service. This is part of the charm of having a lab to work with and test behavior in.</p>
			<p>A popular passive TAP is the Throwing Star LAN TAP by Great Scott Gadgets. It can be found at <a href="https://greatscottgadgets.com/throwingstar/">https://greatscottgadgets.com/throwingstar/</a>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer187" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_5.12_B16321.jpg" alt="Figure 5.12 – Throwing Star LAN TAP&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.12 – Throwing Star LAN TAP</p>
			<p>There are four connectors on the Throwing Star labeled J1 – J4, where J1 and J2 are the inline connections and J3 and J4 are the monitoring ports. For our lab, we will connect J1 to the Koyo CLICK PLC and then use a cable to connect J2 to the switch. Once you've done that, connect J3 to your laptop and use Wireshark, TShark, or Tcpdump to capture the traffic, as we did in the previous section. In this example, we will use TShark to capture and <a id="_idIndexMarker290"/>display the traffic. As you may recall from the <em class="italic">Installing Wireshark</em> section, TShark is an optional component that can be added during the installation process. Type in the following command to do so:</p>
			<p class="source-code">Tshark -i &lt;interface&gt; </p>
			<p>Similar to Tcpdump, the <strong class="source-inline">-i</strong> handle allows you to choose which interface you would like to utilize for the capture process. I will use the same interface we did previously here; that is, <strong class="source-inline">en6</strong>. You can see the command for this in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer188" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_5.13_B16321.jpg" alt="Figure 5.13 – Throwing Star LAN TAP capture&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.13 – Throwing Star LAN TAP capture</p>
			<p>The packets that are captured will and should be the same format we saw previously. I am including a screenshot here so that you can compare it with the previous capture of Tcpdump:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer189" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_5.14_B16321.jpg" alt="Figure 5.14 – TShark packet capture&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.14 – TShark packet capture</p>
			<p>Here, you can see how using a TAP can be very useful for gaining insight into a network. If you have physical access to a switch, you can simply insert the TAP and start capturing the data exchange on that port. This will allow you to understand the protocols being used, and possibly capture unique and sensitive information being passed and exchanged on the network.</p>
			<p>Many vendors sell LAN TAPs, but I do recommend looking at what Hak5 has to offer in this space. Here is a link to their store and their implant tools in particular: <a href="https://shop.hak5.org/collections/implants">https://shop.hak5.org/collections/implants</a>. </p>
			<p>You can find the Throwing Star LAN TAP, the Throwing Star LAN TAP Pro, and other great implant <a id="_idIndexMarker291"/>tools such as the Packet Squirrel and the Plunder Bug LAN TAP. A Plunder Bug LAN TAP can be used to capture traffic in real time, exactly the same way as the Throwing Star LAN TAP does, to capture straight to USB-C. I wish to briefly mentioned Packet Squirrel as it can be left behind on engagements; you can recover it at a later date. We can set the payload to auto-generate PCAPs, which are very helpful when you want to discover possible credentials floating across the network. I know this strictly isn't a TAP per se, but you can connect it to Hak5 Cloud C2 for management and exfil, which allows you to gain access to the network traffic of interest: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer190" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.15 – Packet Squirrel</p>
			<p>If you look <a id="_idIndexMarker292"/>at the payload select switch, you will see that you can launch a number of pre-canned exploits. You can also spend time writing your own custom payload.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Story time</p>
			<p class="callout">In the fall of 2016, I traveled to California to hang out at the Hak5 office. They were hosting a Red Team training event called <strong class="bold">Pentest with Hak5</strong>. There were a number of us attending <a id="_idIndexMarker293"/>the training event and the group hung out with Darren Kitchen, Sebastian Kinne, Rob "Mubix" Fuller, and Shannon Morse "Snubs." We spent a week doing hands-on training, learning how to use the Wi-Fi Pineapple, LAN Turtle, Rubber Ducky, and deep dive Metasploit. We practiced using the tools provided to us and at the end of the week, we were tasked with trying to stop the Evil Robot from deleting all the cat images from the internet. The Hak5 team is producing new and interesting tools that can and should be utilized in the field. I definitely recommend looking at their gear and becoming familiar with it. <strong class="bold">– ThunderCats 2016 </strong></p>
			<p>So far, we've talked <a id="_idIndexMarker294"/>about portable "implant" type TAPs. However, there are commercial-grade TAPs that companies utilize to build out-of-band security monitoring networks. There are some key vendors that play in this space, with one of the most notable being Gigamon. These larger "active" TAP solutions can support 1G and 10G networks, thus duplicating all the traffic to a monitoring device. We will see these devices specifically in "nuclear" installations and, potentially, depending on corporate <a id="_idIndexMarker295"/>security budgets, energy and other notable industrial industries. I'm saying this as the cost of the hardware and the sheer volume of the installation is typically a non-starter for most organizations, hence the de facto use of SPAN/mirror ports for IDS passive monitoring solutions. </p>
			<p>In this section, we discussed how you will encounter TAPs in some shape or form throughout your career, whether it be from gaining access to an out-of-band network while pentesting or from leaving an implant behind. It is very important to familiarize yourself with the different vendors in this space and to also utilize them in your lab. We installed a Throwing Star LAN TAP and used TShark to verify that we were capturing unicast communication between the Koyo Click PLC and the engineering software we installed in <a href="B16321_02_Epub_AM.xhtml#_idTextAnchor027"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Route the Hardware</em>. This has acted as a lead-up to the next section, where we will discuss IDS and the important role it started to play in industrial networks.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-55"><a id="_idTextAnchor056"/>Navigating IDS security monitoring</h1>
			<p>So far, we have <a id="_idIndexMarker296"/>installed Wireshark, learned about and configured a SPAN/mirror port, and installed a "passive" TAP. This has all led to this section. For those of you who are "purists" that may doubt the veracity of passive monitoring, note that various vendor technologies have been widely adopted and are encountered in almost all pentest engagements. I guess there is something to be said about a company's security maturity: as they engage in third-party pentests, it would be safe to say that these same companies invest in new monitoring tools for their industrial networks.  </p>
			<p>In this section, we will touch on the various vendors in the IDS security monitoring space, provide a high-level overview of what they typically detect, how they plug into the broader security suite of tools for events and alerting, and learn how to bypass these products <a id="_idIndexMarker297"/>and go undetected during a pentesting engagement. This is because it is quite defeating having an IDS detect your IP address and <a id="_idIndexMarker298"/>send an API call to a <strong class="bold">Network Access Control</strong> (<strong class="bold">NAC</strong>), and then have that NAC push a set of new <strong class="bold">Security Group Tags</strong> (<strong class="bold">SGTs</strong>), essentially <a id="_idIndexMarker299"/>dropping your MAC address on all the switches:</p>

			<p>The idea and implementation of IDS has been around since the 1980s. This technology was driven by the need to bolster network security. Over the last 4 decades, many companies have either been bought, sold, or faded away. The evolution of IDS is very interesting and history-rich, but I want to narrow down and focus on the direct impact of IDS as it relates to the industrial space. In 1998, "Snort" was created, an "open source" network IDS. Like most technologies, "Snort" allowed hobbyists and other new start-up companies to leverage the rule-based engine and develop deeper detections. Fast forward another decade and companies such as Digital Bond and Industrial Defender started using custom rules tailored for industrial equipment and detecting malicious activities and attacks. </p>
			<p>In 2009, a company called "Security Matters" was founded in the Netherlands, focusing specifically on industrial network detection. 11 years ago, in March 2010, a paper titled "Sophia Proof of Concept Report" was published by three researchers working for the Idaho National Laboratory. The idea was to visually fingerprint industrial networks by simply listening to network traffic. </p>
			<p>In 2013, two companies were founded – one in the United States called "Dragos" and another in Switzerland called "Nozomi Networks" – both of which had products in the passive monitoring space. The former "Dragos" had a product called Cyberlens and the latter "Nozomi Networks" had a product called SCADAguardian.  </p>
			<p>In 2014, the industrial <a id="_idIndexMarker300"/>intrusion detection market exploded with a dozen or more companies launching such systems. The bulk came out of Israel and were championed by ex 8200 IDF members, though notable mentions include Indegy, SCADAFence, and Claroty. Sentryo was also founded in 2014 and was headquartered in France. All these companies are in a "protocol dissector" race, a race to see which company can produce the most diverse and comprehensive arsenal for asset discovery.  </p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we are going to deep dive into protocols and how they are structured, but for now, the most important take away is that IDS monitoring devices perform deep packet inspection and analyze the traffic for malicious behavior. All the systems mentioned previously track when new key elements occur, such as the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>New MAC address detected in the network</li>
				<li>New IP address detected in the network</li>
				<li>New protocol detected in the network</li>
				<li>New communication path detected in the network</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These are elements you should keep in the back of your mind as you pivot through your customer's network from the corporate side down into the industrial network. Knowing that your machine will be detected and fingerprinted will help you develop different techniques and strategies to cover your tracks. At this point, we know that if these systems detect a new device and new communication, they will generate an event or alert, depending on the naming convention for each system. Understanding how the alert is handled by the IDS will be crucial; is the system integrated with an NAC or firewall? Will the integration cause an issue with traversing deeper into the network? Does the firewall block our connection attempts to lower-level systems? Does the NAC push SGTs to the switches it manages, ultimately dropping packets? All these are important questions to address when navigating a network.  </p>
			<p>Not all is lost, however, even with systems fully tuned and deploying the latest packet rules, YARA rules, signatures, and integrations. Fortunately, these IDS monitoring systems have <a id="_idIndexMarker301"/>weaknesses in their armor that we can exploit. Here is a short list of exploitable tactics we can use to subvert passive monitoring:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Node license saturation</li>
				<li>Alert exhaustion </li>
				<li>Other protocol or uncommon port</li>
				<li>Encrypted protocol usage</li>
				<li>Living off the land</li>
			</ul>
			<p>I would be doing a disservice if I were to leave you with the impression that all IDS are vulnerable to these exploits. These are simply some tactics that have been discovered through previous engagements and research, and they affect various IDS devices in different ways.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-56"><a id="_idTextAnchor057"/>Node license saturation</h2>
			<p>This technique works by introducing numerous new nodes to the network, which ultimately <a id="_idIndexMarker302"/>causes the monitoring solution to hit the license node count. After that, you can introduce your attack strategy since the IDS solution won't detect and/or alert your device as you pivot deeper into the network. By doing this, you have effectively blinded the system from viewing your activity.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-57"><a id="_idTextAnchor058"/>Alert exhaustion</h2>
			<p>This is similar to node license saturation, but the IDS solution isn't vulnerable to a license <a id="_idIndexMarker303"/>count limit. Instead, it simply creates so much noise that the end user will never find the activity. Once again, this introduces an excessive number of new nodes and activity into the network, which can easily create hundreds of thousands of alerts in the system. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-58"><a id="_idTextAnchor059"/>Other protocol or uncommon port</h2>
			<p>This works by utilizing uncommon ports to pass your attack through the system.  Depending <a id="_idIndexMarker304"/>on the monitoring system, if the port hasn't been associated with a dissector, the IDS will tag the traffic as "other" and not perform any further analysis on it. An example would be passing HTTP over a non-standard port.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-59"><a id="_idTextAnchor060"/>Encrypted protocol usage</h2>
			<p>This is specifically for referencing or utilizing port <strong class="source-inline">443</strong> or HTTPS for a reverse shell through <a id="_idIndexMarker305"/>the network. Communication via port <strong class="source-inline">443</strong> is typically allowed as it gets tagged as HTTPS communication, so no further analysis is typically performed on the link, allowing us to pass through undetected.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-60"><a id="_idTextAnchor061"/>Living off the land</h2>
			<p>This is the most evasive tactic when it comes to performing pentests, since we can utilize devices <a id="_idIndexMarker306"/>and protocols that are already present in the network to go undetected. Very prominent attacks in the past utilized this strategy and led to a certain nuclear program being crippled – and yes, this is a reference to "Stuxnet." Gaining access to an HMI, data historian, or operator workstation allows us to send set point changes or configuration changes via normal methods and actions. Opening and closing valves from an HMI appears to be normal behavior and will go unnoticed in the network.</p>
			<p>In this section, we discussed what an IDS is and the history of the evolution of industrial IDS. We discussed what and how an IDS discovers and detects, and we also <a id="_idIndexMarker307"/>covered some methods for obfuscating our attacks from detection. Knowing about and utilizing these details will help you in the future during a customer engagement. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-61"><a id="_idTextAnchor062"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we learned what SPAN/mirroring and TAPs are, as well as the importance of understanding how they fit into the ICS ecosystem. Knowing what to look for on the network and how to interact with it is key to having a successful outcome. Discovering what traffic is communicating and exchanging data allows us to build out a network topology of the assets the client has in their network. Utilizing technologies such as Wireshark, TShark, and Tcpdump to listen to and review the traffic in real time is required during an engagement. More advanced technologies, such as the IDS vendors listed in this chapter, will even divulge auto-discovered vulnerabilities.  </p>
			<p>In the next chapter, which is all about listening to a SPAN or TAP on the network, we will build packet captures that will allow us to analyze and dissect protocols being passed on the network. This is the secret sauce that IDS companies use to build out their product. This is an arms race for protocol dissectors. We will be deep diving into the packets and packet captures in the next chapter, <a href="B16321_06_Epub_AM.xhtml#_idTextAnchor063"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a><em class="italic">, Packet Deep Dive</em>.</p>
