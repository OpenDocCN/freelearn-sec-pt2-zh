    We installed an ESXi server and multiple VMs, and set up our PLC to communicate
    with the VMs. We also installed a light tower and wired the I/O to the PLC. We
    installed Ignition SCADA and connected it to our PLC in the lab, and used various
    tools to scan our install and detect open ports and paths that a developer may
    have left open on the web-based SCADA system.

    **Industrial Control Systems** (**ICS**). We will be utilizing the VMs that we
    created in [*Chapter 1*](B16321_01_Epub_AM.xhtml#_idTextAnchor013), *Using Virtualization*,
    to generate protocol-specific traffic and we will then make use of Wireshark and
    TShark to analyze the protocol in further detail, much like we did in [*Chapter
    6*](B16321_06_Epub_AM.xhtml#_idTextAnchor063), *Packet Deep Dive*. As you read
    through this book, you should get the feeling that every chapter is building on
    the previous chapter, helping to reinforce the skills that you have learned, and
    then we want to add on a new skill or nugget of knowledge that we will expand
    on later.

    However, I feel that it would have been almost an injustice to not at least touch
    on the width and breadth of the industrial protocol space. Every industry and
    region that I have come across has tended to gravitate toward one specific vendor
    or another. On some continents, I have seen products, vendors, and protocols of

    protocol and tested side by side to ensure that the process control strategy functions
    as intended. Modicon published the Modbus standard and Schneider Electric acquired
    Modicon through a series of acquisitions and mergers. This means, when you discover

    connecting equipment in an industrial process over a common bus. Since Modbus''s
    publication, there have been many evolutions of the protocol and variants. This
    is largely due to the openness and flexibility of the protocol standard. As this
    protocol is the most broadly used for connecting industrial equipment, you can
    imagine there have been many books and papers written on the subject. We are going
    to focus specifically on Modbus TCP and the various commands and functions that
    can be used. I strongly recommend reading up on the history and evolution of Modbus,
    as you will gain a deeper insight into how industry has adapted this protocol
    to suite their process and specific operational needs. Follow this link to get

    model, allowing a client to communicate with multiple servers and transmit operational
    and control data back and forth. Operational and control inputs and outputs utilize
    various registers depending on the implementation and content of the data. Following

    a PLC, RTU, flow computer, GC, controller, or any other technology that is running
    Modbus as the primary control or operational protocol. This plays a very important
    role while pentesting. If you gather enough information, you will have the ability
    to piece together how the control data can manipulate the real-world process.

    on the protocol and the capabilities of it. I would recommend getting familiar
    with **mbtget** and playing with the package as it is a powerful tool written
    in Perl. We quickly spun up **pymodbus** as a server; however, there are more
    examples where you can run **pymodbus** in client mode as well. From here, we
    will look at Ethernet/IP. It is a widely used protocol, not because of a mass-adopted
    standard but more because of a sales team that did a great job of getting their
    technology out there and into many different industries.

    was due to the fact that it became the foundational protocol utilized and baked
    into Rockwell Automation products. It started popping up in the control engineering
    space in the late 90s, almost two decades after Modbus. **Common Industrial Protocol**
    (**CIP**) messages are the core element that powers Ethernet/IP. It is the object-oriented
    and open nature of CIP that has allowed quick adoption in the market. An interesting
    stat that I came across was that Ethernet/IP was estimated to have had 30% utilization
    in the industrial global market share. This is quite substantial and the reason
    why it makes it worth discussing and reviewing in this book. For a more in-depth
    and detailed read on the Ethernet/IP protocol, use the link [https://www.odva.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/PUB00035R0_Infrastructure_Guide.pdf](https://www.odva.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/PUB00035R0_Infrastructure_Guide.pdf)

    unconnected explicit messages to the PLC. At first glance, the protocol structure
    looks complex and tedious as compared to Modbus, but after a bit of research and
    trial and error, we discover that the class/instance/attribute structure of the
    address makes it rather simple to send and receive commands with. This is important.
    As we stated in the introduction, 30%+ of global industrial equipment utilizes
    this protocol to operate processes. Whether it be operating conveyer belts at
    an Amazon fulfillment center or starting and stopping a mainline compressor station
    for Colonial Pipeline, you will certainly find this protocol during your adventures
    in your industrial pentesting career.

    you need when turning in a final discovery report to your customer. Many times
    in my career, I have seen a report that simply documents assets discovered on
    a network utilizing an *insecure* protocol. When pressed for details of what impact
    an asset using an *insecure* protocol could have on the organization, the response
    typically has little to no substance. Having exposure at the packet level allows
    you to supply richer assessment findings than simply saying *insecure* protocol.
    Here is a quick example from our findings.

    that a Koyo Click C0-10ARE-D is running in the network and is vulnerable to unconnected
    explicit messaging at address **0x04/102/3**. This address, when manipulated,
    will allow us to turn OFF and ON the lights in the lab.
