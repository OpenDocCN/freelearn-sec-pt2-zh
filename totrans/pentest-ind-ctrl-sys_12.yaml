- en: When working through the system by gaining access to critical accounts and infrastructure,
    as exciting as it is to "capture flags and turn off lights," a successful engagement
    is measured by the findings, documented evidence, and recommendations provided
    in the report. Just like building a strong skillset for compromising systems,
    equal time and diligence needs to be applied to turn over a perfect engagement
    report.
