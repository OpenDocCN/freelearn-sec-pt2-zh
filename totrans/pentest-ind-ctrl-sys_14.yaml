    where we must collect all the information that we captured and correlate the data
    into a report. Know that if there is no report, then the engagement never happened.
    From a business perspective, this is fundamentally the most pivotal part of the
    pentesting engagement. In this chapter, we will discuss how to build a report
    template, backfill that template with key information found during the engagement,
    and finally provide some remediation points to help close the security gap.

    possibly, if you are working for a larger company, corporate branding. Getting
    the theme, icons, logos, and brands out of the way, at the core, there is a fundamental
    structure that should be used as a guideline to build your report against. Now,
    depending on your educational background, talking about report structure might
    come across as redundant; however, it is critical to build a clear and concise
    report that can be easily ingested by your customer because if they can't follow
    the flow of the report, it might be the last engagement you have with that client.

    is vital to a successful pentesting career. With each engagement and deliverable,
    you can modify, tweak, and enhance the template to make a dynamite report. I personally
    feel that even if you are the best technical pentester but you cannot write a
    report, even if your life depended on it, then you will have a very hard career
    ahead of you. I think the big houses have spent years building out their report
    templates, and the few of us running smaller shops are still sharpening our reporting

    useful, and reusable data and store it, so that we can compile it for the information
    gathering section. This data needs to be communicated to the customer if it divulges
    too much detail that ultimately opens the door for a threat actor to slip in.

    configurations on two controllers. One controller was managing and operating a
    compressor and the other controller was operating a pump. No one caught the error
    until it was too late; the compressor blew all the seals and the pump cavitated.
    Needless to say, there was major disruption and financial losses for something
    so simple as pushing a new configuration to a PLC, much like we did in [*Chapter
    3*](B16321_03_Epub_AM.xhtml#_idTextAnchor033), *I Love My Bits – Lab Setup*. No
    lives were lost, which is fortunate, but this is a cautionary tale of being absolutely
    cautious when you gain access at the control level. If automation engineers who
    designed the system can make a simple mistake and cause tens of millions of dollars'
    worth of damage, imagine what damage a pentester could do by spraying the network
    with scans, scripts, and pushing different configurations to PLCs, RTUs, **Human
    Machine Interfaces** (**HMIs**), or controllers.

    the lateral movement and privilege escalation. In [*Chapter 12*](B16321_12_Epub_AM.xhtml#_idTextAnchor139),
    *I See the Future*, we gained access to the user interface of the SCADA system,
    which is a great example of absolute system control. We would document our findings
    from [*Chapter 12*](B16321_12_Epub_AM.xhtml#_idTextAnchor139), *I See the Future*,
    in the impact analysis, due to the fact that we were able to reuse credentials
    discovered in the operations network; we could authenticate to the SCADA system
    and ultimately lock every user out and shut down the system. The key importance
    here is knowing the industry that your customer is in, which should have been
    discovered in the pre-engagement, kick-off meeting, or information-gathering step.
    Different industries will contain different levels of impact, and knowing this
    will be critical to document potential losses.

    subscription service. If a rogue malicious file is detected on the system, it
    is tagged, and a signature is generated and submitted to WildFire. Any customer
    subscribed to WildFire has the ability to automatically pull down the signature
    and add it to the list of detection signatures inside the PA-220R. This service,
    if enabled, can be painfully annoying, as it requires some advanced strategies
    using **MSFvenom** and **Shikata Ga Nai**, which is a polymorphic encoder for
    generating reverse shellcode. This helps prevent WildFire from stopping unique
    files containing shellcode from being blocked across entire industries. More information
    about the Palo Alto ruggedized firewall can be found at the following link: [https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/next-generation-firewall/pa-220r](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/next-generation-firewall/pa-220r).'

    Touting a library of 1500 ICS protocols, I can definitely vouch for a number of
    these and, specifically, the protocols that we discussed in [*Chapter 8*](B16321_08_Epub_AM.xhtml#_idTextAnchor097),

    in industrial networks. These solutions are a mixture of agents, rules, baselines,
    policies, and signatures. The deployment method was to install agents on the workstations,
    data historians, SCADA servers, and various other equipment, and have those agents
    collect key operational information from the assets that they are installed on
    and send it to a collection point. At this collection point, rules and signatures
    are applied to detect changes or anomalous behavior on the endpoint. This generates
    alerts and events that can be monitored by a security team. The following diagram
    is what a typical installation could look like inside our lab:'

    if not the first, industrial cybersecurity solutions to hit the market. This product
    can be found on six or seven continents in multiple industries and landed a heavy
    presence in the electrical utility industry, as it embraced the **North American
    Electric Reliability Corporation** (**NERC**) **Critical Infrastructure Protection**
    (**CIP**) standard and provided an automated solution that aided utilities in
    adhering to compliance requirements. This product allows the customer to have
    a complete granularity of every asset in the network, software installed, users
    that have access, firewall rules applied, patches applied, services running, and
    much more. If a new account is locally created, an alert is instantly triggered
    and sent off to the security team, due to the fact that the baseline of the asset
    has been altered. The following link can provide more solution information: [https://www.industrialdefender.com/ot-cyber-risk-management/](https://www.industrialdefender.com/ot-cyber-risk-management/).'

    allows customers to keep track of their PLC, RTU, and controller source code,
    and perform differentials on files, looking for any major issues that could rear
    their ugly head, plus the added value of having a gold copy of the source for
    a quick rollback. If you follow this link, you will find more information about

    Can*, I covered IDS in great detail, and now we are talking about them again due
    to the fact that they really have taken the industry by storm, and at the time
    of writing this, Dragos, Claroty, and Nozomi Networks have all raised $100 million
    of additional capital, which means that these technologies certainly have legs
    and the confidence of institutional investors. Dale Peterson and Roger Collins
    started a company called Digital Bond over two decades before the writing of this
    book. They wrote the first signatures for the IDS space. I wonder if they knew
    at the time that the industry would grow as dramatically as it has, with companies
    such as SecurityMatters, Indegy, CyberX, and Sentryo being acquired for close
    to a combined value of $500 million, and then the previous three companies adding
    over $300 million extra in funding, in addition to companies such as SCADAfence
    and Armis, which tips the industry value into well over $1 billion. If the company
    you come across doesn''t have an IDS, I would say that this is an easy win when
    it comes to recommendations. If you look at the following diagram, you can see
    the typical placement of IDS sensors, although you can have variable numbers of
    sensors scattered around the network:'

    talent to develop a holistic solution. The unique part of the product is the battle-tested
    playbooks that they incorporate into the solution. On top of the detection and
    alerting features that generate events, there lies a module that provides clients
    with plans of actions to take to close any security gaps that are detected. This
    allows for the product to be managed and monitored by non-industry experts, which
    happens to be one of the biggest issues in industrial cybersecurity – the drastic
    lack of skilled talent. If you come across this technology, know that you have
    a high probability of having your device being blacklisted across the switchgear.

    and they have published information on multiple vulnerabilities for the community
    to consume and detect. One of the most interesting features is the root-cause
    analysis that the platform performs. This allows the user to trace from where
    a security breach or vulnerability started. A lot of research goes into a module
    that performs this unique analysis, and the customer base benefits from this and
    enables the security team to plug the holes. For more information, follow this
