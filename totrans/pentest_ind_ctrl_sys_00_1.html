			<p><strong class="bold">Industrial control systems</strong> (<strong class="bold">ICS</strong>) are the heart and soul of critical infrastructure. Understanding the process they impact goes a long way toward understanding the vendors chosen and devices running. Due to the nature of the ICS space having many verticals, such as power, energy, chemical, water, manufacturing, transportation, building management, and amusement parks, to name a few, and under these main verticals there being subcategories, such as production/generation, delivery/distribution, and refining, it becomes difficult to build an extensive lab. However, for all intents and purposes, we will be building a test lab as a starting point to explore tactics, techniques, and procedures. This starter lab will help you to develop a foundation that will be scalable as more equipment is accumulated over the years.</p>
