<p class="mce-root"><span>Network scanning is the process of building an inventory of IT infrastructure assets by identifying an active host on a network. Similar methods can be used by an attacker or network administrator to assess security. This procedure plays a vital role in risk assessment programs and the preparation of a security plan for your organization.</span><br/>
<span><em>Practical Network Scanning</em> starts with the concept of network scanning and how organizations can benefit from it. Then, going forward, we delve into the different steps involved in scanning, such as service detection, firewall detection, TCP/IP port detection, and OS detection. We also implement these concepts using a few of the most prominent tools on the market, such as Nessus and Nmap. In the concluding chapters, we prepare a complete vulnerability assessment plan for your organization. </span><span>By the end of this book, you will have hands-on experience of performing network scanning using different tools and in choosing the best tools of your system.</span></p>

<p>To understand the content of this book, it is recommended that you have basic knowledge of computer networks. If you are certified with CCNA network and security, that will be a good foundation for you to advance your knowledge about computer networks by reading this book.</p>
<p>As you know, it does not make sense to learn about computer networks without doing any practical work. Therefore, it is suggested that you practice TCP/IP, IP Packet Flow, Basic network design and setting up a LAN with at least a Cisco switch and router. Download emulators and simulators such as PuTTY and Tera Term, Packet Tracer and GNS3, Wireshark, Nmap, Nessus. All of the download links are included in the book.</p>
