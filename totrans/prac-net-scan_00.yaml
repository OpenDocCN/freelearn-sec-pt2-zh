- en: Network scanning is the process of building an inventory of IT infrastructure
    assets by identifying an active host on a network. Similar methods can be used
    by an attacker or network administrator to assess security. This procedure plays
    a vital role in risk assessment programs and the preparation of a security plan
    for your organization.

- en: '*Practical Network Scanning* starts with the concept of network scanning and
    how organizations can benefit from it. Then, going forward, we delve into the
    different steps involved in scanning, such as service detection, firewall detection,
    TCP/IP port detection, and OS detection. We also implement these concepts using
    a few of the most prominent tools on the market, such as Nessus and Nmap. In the
    concluding chapters, we prepare a complete vulnerability assessment plan for your
    organization. By the end of this book, you will have hands-on experience of performing
    network scanning using different tools and in choosing the best tools of your
    system.'

- en: As you know, it does not make sense to learn about computer networks without
    doing any practical work. Therefore, it is suggested that you practice TCP/IP,
    IP Packet Flow, Basic network design and setting up a LAN with at least a Cisco
    switch and router. Download emulators and simulators such as PuTTY and Tera Term,
    Packet Tracer and GNS3, Wireshark, Nmap, Nessus. All of the download links are
    included in the book.
