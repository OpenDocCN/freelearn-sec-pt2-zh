    totally depends on the network architecture, which includes protection for network
    perimeters, subnets, and zones. Perimeter firewalls are always placed on a network's
    edge to filter packets entering the network. Perimeter firewalls are the first
    layer of security, and if malicious traffic has managed to bypass, host-based
    firewalls provide another layer of protection by allowing or denying packets coming
    into the end host device. This is called the multilayer security approach. Multiple
    firewalls can be set up to design a highly secure environment.

    before. We are seeing new security controls, policies, and best practices put
    in place within organizations, but every day security breaches continue to take
    place. Nobody is 100% protected from small to large organizations. It only takes
    a simple mistake from an uneducated end user to leave a back door open in your
    information security. Organizations need to be aware of the people they work with,
    within the organization and outside as well. Developing adequate training and
    security frameworks for employee and end users becomes very important for protecting
    systems, especially considering the fact that it''s not just technology which
    plays an important role, but also its users. I again repeat: if you have internet
    enabled devices, it is also your responsibility to secure them.'

    the dangers of this threat and the potential impact on almost any industry. In
    2018, it is predicted that IOT will be a big target for attackers in upcoming
    years, as well as Cloud infrastructures, **Artificial Intelligence** (**AI**),
    and of course the rise of mobile attackers increases daily.
