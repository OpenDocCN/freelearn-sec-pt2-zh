<p>In the previous chapter, we discussed how to build a secure network infrastructure. In this chapter, we will discuss how to build and ensure security for servers inside a secure network.</p>
<p>Server/computer security is a critical part of the infrastructure for running business smoothly. Information security has evolved over the years due to an increasing dependency on public networks not to disclose personal, financial, and other restricted information. Consequently, it becomes important to maintain data confidentiality, integrity and availability. This chapter focuses on securing data and implementing various policies to secure a server infrastructure.</p>
<p>We will cover the following topics in this chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li class="mce-root">Classification of data</li>
<li class="mce-root">Physical security</li>
<li class="mce-root">Disk encryption</li>
<li class="mce-root">Hardening server security</li>
<li class="mce-root">Authentication NTLM versus Kerberos</li>
<li class="mce-root">Password policies</li>
<li class="mce-root">Server-level permissions</li>
<li class="mce-root">Server antivirus and malware protection</li>
<li class="mce-root">Local security policies</li>

<p>The main motive for setting up IT infrastructure is to get your applications up and running. However, after classifying our assets, we need to address the security when it comes to one layer on a server specific infrastructure. In a big network of multi-vendor servers and multi-operating system environments, different sets of applications are expected. A grouping server based on role, permission, and operating system can address multiple security concerns.</p>

<p>In most cases, physical access translates to a total loss of security. Even if they can't access your data, an attacker can do a lot of damage. We'll take a look at the most essential security measures everyone should implement, if they haven't already been done:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lock up the server room</strong>:<strong> </strong>The server room is the power station of your physical network, and someone with physical access to the servers, switches, routers, cables, and other devices in that room can do enormous damage.</li>
<li><strong>Set up surveillance</strong>: You need a way to monitor who goes in and out, what they do and when they do it. A better solution is to set up biometric scanners that are required in order to unlock the doors, and the identity of each technician is then recorded. Surveillance cameras can monitor continuously, or they can use motion detection technology to record a person's movement. They can even send an email or cell phone notification if motion is detected when it shouldn't be.</li>
<li><strong>Disable the drives</strong>:<strong> </strong>Of course, for a protected environment, we don't want anybody copying company information to removable media. You should simply disable or remove USB ports and other ways of connecting external drives.</li>
<li><strong>Educate your employees</strong>:<strong> </strong>Apart from technology, this is the most important factor behind security. It is necessary to train staff on security related issues such as password selection, social engineering tactics, and email phishing. This will make it almost impossible for an outsider to intrude.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is important to secure any server that manages business critical data and its customers. The fact that servers reside in a secured facility doesn't prevent them from being at risk to data loss or theft. Sometimes storage drives in a server are misplaced during transportation, which can lead to data loss. Another example would be to prevent offline attacks. If data drives are stolen and inserted into another system to boot with another operating system, this basically bypasses the password protection. If that drive isn't encrypted, its information can be retrieved and exposed to unwanted audiences, leaving an organization at risk of regulatory violations, personal lawsuits, and damage to its corporate reputation.</p>

<p>Let's explore the process in detail, looking at how the whole disk encryption works. Full disk encryption encrypts an entire disk drive. When an authenticated user accesses a file from a fully encrypted drive, the encryption technology decrypts the file using the decryption key provided at system startup, and the rest of the drive remains encrypted. This method ensures the protection of the hard drive if a system failure occurs or the system is deliberately shutdown. The primary goal of full disk encryption is that the drive and files remain encrypted during the system shutdown state. On a running system, the encryption is technically not in place for users to access files. This is because the operating system has the decryption key to access files on the disk.</p>

<p>BitLocker is Microsoft native technology that enables you to encrypt entire hard disks, including the operating system. To get the best results from BitLocker, a hardware system must be equipped with a <strong>Trusted Platform Module</strong> (<strong>TPM</strong>) chip. This is a special microchip that enables your device to support advanced security features. However, you can also use BitLocker without a TPM by using a software-based encryption.</p>
<p>The TPM chip 2.0 can be seen<span> under security devices</span> in the device manager:</p>

<p><strong>Trusted Computing Group</strong> (<strong>TCG</strong>) introduced TPM in 2009. A <strong>Trusted Platform Module</strong> (<strong>TPM</strong>) is a microchip that is often built into the motherboard to provide hardware-based security. This can be also be added later for customized systems if your motherboard supports it. A TPM chip is a secure crypto-processor that is designed to carry out cryptographic operations. If you are using BitLocker encryption on a computer with the TPM, part of the key is stored in the TPM itself, rather than just on the disk. This means that an attacker can't just remove the drive from the computer and attempt to access its files elsewhere.</p>
<p>In Windows server 2016 Hyper-v and Windows 10, you can enable vTPM into a VM. Virtual instance will be mapped to each VM, as shown in the following diagram:</p>

<p>In a virtualized environment, encrypting guest virtual machines is another layer of protection that you can add in Hyper-V. You may wonder what the need is for this if encrypting the Hyper-V host itself can protect against stolen physical disks. Enabling BitLocker inside your virtual machines protects against stolen virtual disks as well. For example, if an attacker manages to gain access to an online Hyper-V, host and VHDX or VHD files can be downloaded or stolen. </p>
<p>Here is the screenshot from Hyper-V 2016 in which the vTPM option is disabled by default. As soon you turn on the feature, it can share virtualized TPM instances with VMs:</p>

Having said that, it also states that the disk is encrypted at rest with <strong>Storage Service Encryption</strong> (<strong>SSE</strong>).

<p>Encryption at rest refers to the cryptographic encoding of data when it is persevered on physical media. Encryption at rest is supposed to protect data from at rest attacks, including attempts to obtain physical media access where the data is stored. In such an attack, a server's hard drive may have been stolen or misplaced, allowing an attacker to recover data from the hard drive by putting it into a compute device of their own. Encryption at rest is designed to prevent critical data access by unauthorized persons by ensuring that the data remains encrypted when it resides on a disk. An attacker can obtain a hard drive with data in an encrypted format, but without access to the encryption keys, they would not be able to decode the data. Encryption at rest is highly recommended and is a high-priority requirement for many organizations, including cloud service providers, to allow them to comply with state law government regulations and industry standards such as HIPAA and PCI. </p>

<p>Most of us assume that systems or servers are already secure, and this might be a false assumption. Imagine if any system server, firewall or router is stolen without first being hardened. An attacker would probably first try to crack a targeted system with a default username and password. For a Linux based machine, my default username would be <kbd>root</kbd><em>,</em> the password would be <kbd>root</kbd>, and most of us would continue to use it. Server hardening involves identifying and re-mediating security vulnerabilities. We will discuss server hardening and the best practices you can implement immediately in order to reduce the risk of attackers compromising your business's critical systems and data.</p>

<p>To restrict traffic based on firewall rules, traffic should only be allowed into ports that need to be open for services. For example, secure web servers will need to provide access to TCP port <kbd>443</kbd> to most users, but they do not need <strong>Remote Desktop Protocol</strong> (<strong>RDP</strong>) or <strong>Secure Shell</strong> (<strong>SSH</strong>) management access from all source IPs.</p>
<p>For Windows, you can configure new inbound and outbound rules using advanced security options:</p>

<p><strong><span>Universal Serial Bus</span></strong> (<strong><span>USB</span></strong>) connections are typically plug and play devices. For example, hard disks or pen drives for your computer. Being plug and play in nature, an operating system automatically identifies the device and installs a driver for it. Since USB devices are portable and can be connected easily to computers, these devices can cause real security threats. To prevent employees from saving sensitive information on USB drives, financial organizations do not allow USB devices. The system administrator can disable or block USB devices using group policy. We will now take a look at the steps on how to disable USB devices using group policy.</p>

<p>Disk encryption is important in the case of theft.

We have already discussed this option in detail in the <em>Full-disk encryption</em> section of this chapter.</p>

<p>It is important to protect the BIOS of the system with a password so that attackers won't be able to use it to change security settings. You also need to disable the booting from external media devices (USB/CD/DVD). BIOS protection is only an authentication mechanism designed to prevent unauthorized physical access to BIOS. BIOS now comes with out-of-band access, meaning that, with the right hardware configuration, you have full remote access to your computer, no matter what state it is in.</p>

<p>Don't forget to protect your passwords and do not reuse them. Use a password policy to ensure that accounts on the server can't be compromised or broken by some sort of brute-force attack. If your server is a member of <strong>Active Directory Domain Services</strong> (<strong>ADDS</strong>), the password policy will be set at the domain level. We will discuss password policies in detail in an upcoming section.</p>

<p>SSH uses the cryptography process running at the backend, and therefore is considered very secure. However, you still need to harden this service as well. Make sure you are running the latest version of SSH protocol, and SSH sources can be further restricted with IP subnet. Remote Desktop sessions operate over an encrypted channel, preventing anyone from snooping your session on the network. However, there is a vulnerability in the method used to encrypt sessions in earlier versions of RDP. The best approach would be to update your software, restrict access using firewalls, and set an account lockout policy for additional security. You can also change your RDP port from <kbd>3389</kbd> to something else, using RDP gateways and then finally using 2FA. </p>

<p>You need to make sure that your logs and monitoring are configured and are capturing the data you want so that whenever there is a problem, you can quickly discover who, when, and what you need to fix it. You must set up a centralized log management solution to monitor logs, server health like disk space, CPU, memory, and network activity.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p><strong><span>NT LAN Manager</span></strong> (<span><strong>NTLM</strong>)</span> and Kerberos are <span>both</span><span> </span><span>authentication protocols that do not play any role in terms of authorization. NTLM is a proprietary authentication protocol developed by Microsoft, whereas Kerberos is a standard protocol. Starting with Win2K, Microsoft implements Kerberos as the default authentication protocol for the Windows OS. However, if the Kerberos protocol is not negotiated for some reason, then <strong>Active Directory</strong> (<strong>AD</strong>) will use LM, NTLM, or</span> <strong>NTLM version 2</strong> <span>(</span><strong>NTLMv2</strong><span>).</span></p>
<p>Kerberos is a cryptographic network protocol that works for authenticating users to resources, which involves a client, server, and a <strong>Key Distribution Center</strong> (<strong>KDC</strong>). Kerberos was named after Cerberus, the three-headed dog of Greek mythology, because of its three components. KDC has two components: an <strong>Authentication Server</strong> and a <strong>Ticket Granting Service</strong>, as well as the <strong>Client</strong> and the <strong>Print Server</strong> that the Client wants to access, as shown in the following diagram: </p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-871 image-border" src="Images/b627e6c4-7223-420c-b78a-1b7bce774efa.png" style="width:40.17em;height:34.25em;" width="1721" height="1470"/></div>
<p>Let's try to understand the process step by step:</p>
<ol>
<li>For network domain authentication, a Client provides a username and a password, which is validated by the Authentication Server, a component of KDC.</li>
<li class="mce-root">The KDC grants a <strong>Ticket Getting Ticket</strong> (<strong>TGT</strong>) with a default duration of 10 hours.</li>
<li class="mce-root">When the client attempts to access the Print Server in the domain, the TGT is used to make the request instead of entering credentials again and again. The Client obtains a service ticket from the Ticket Granting Server, a component of KDC.</li>
<li class="mce-root">A service ticket is created for the Client and the Server that the Client wants to access. The service ticket consists of a ticket and a session key. </li>
<li class="mce-root">The Client presents the service ticket to create a session with the service on the Server. The Server uses its key to decrypt the information from the TGS, and the Client is authenticated to the Server.</li>
</ol>
<p>The major differences can be seen in the following table:</p>

<div class="packt_tip">System admins need to make sure they run Kerberos by default. In any scenarios where you need to turn on NTLM, it should be used with caution, keeping risks in mind. </div>

<p>Passwords are an important characteristic of computer security. A poorly constructed, weak password may result in unauthorized access or exploitation of organization IT resources. This password construction guideline applies to all passwords, including (but not limited to) user-level accounts, system-level accounts, web accounts, email accounts, and local router logins. On a Windows system, you can run <kbd>secpol.msc</kbd> from the Command Prompt: </p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/1461fc27-69e3-45c0-ad72-3bf71e46feca.png" style="width:47.33em;height:33.83em;" width="1173" height="838"/></div>
<p>Strong passwords have the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>They contain at least twelve alphanumeric characters</li>
<li>They contain both upper and lowercase letters</li>
<li>They contain at least one number (for example, 0-9)</li>
<li>They contain at least one special character (for example, !$%^*()_+|~-=\`{}[]:";'?,/)</li>
</ul>
<p>Following are some of the password policies we must remember:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Protect your password</strong>:<strong> </strong>It is very challenging to remember your password without writing it down somewhere, so choose a strong password or passphrase that you will easily remember. If you have a lot of passwords, you can use password management tools or vaults, but make sure you choose a strong master key and remember it. Change your password periodically. Even if it hasn't been compromised, you can set a policy to change the password every 90 days, as a standard guideline. Do not use the same password for multiple websites containing sensitive information.</li>
<li><strong>Set a lockout policy</strong>: We've all forgotten a password at some point, and it has taken a few tries to get back into the system. However, you should set an acceptable number of login attempts that when exceeded with unsuccessful attempts, will lock the user out. This will protect your system from any type of Brute-Force attack. </li>
<li><strong>Enforce password history</strong>:<strong> </strong>This security setting determines the number of unique new passwords that have to be associated with a user account before an old password can be reused. The value must be between zero and twenty four passwords on domain controllers.</li>
<li><strong>Minimum password age</strong>: This setting determines the minimum number of days a password must be in use before it can be changed. Only when the minimum password age expires are users allowed to change their password. This ensures that users don't change their password too often. The value can be set between zero and nine hundred and ninety-nine days. The default value is one for domain controllers and zero for standalone servers.</li>
<li class="mce-root"><strong>Minimum password length</strong>:<strong> </strong>This setting determines the minimum number of characters a password should contain. The value can be set between zero and fourteen. The default value is seven on domain controllers and zero on stand-alone servers.</li>
</ul>

<p>In an organization, <span>firstly</span><span> </span><span>you need to identify assets based on the type of server, where each server has a specific role to perform. Server-level roles are server-wide in their permissions scope. You can add server-level principals (server logins, user accounts, and Windows security groups) into server-level roles. Security groups can provide an efficient way to assign access to resources on your network:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="mce-root"><strong>Security groups in Active Directory</strong>:<strong> </strong>User rights are assigned to a security group to determine what members of that group can do within the scope of a domain or forest. For example, default domain admins have full permission on all server parts of that specific domain irrespective of server roles. However, we can create user defined groups and add the required user account to that group to limit access.</li>
<li><strong>Windows service accounts</strong>: There are applications that run on Windows servers that need an account that is specific to that service. A service account helps in solving this problem and acts as a user identity that is associated with a service executable for the purpose of providing a security context for that service.</li>
</ul>

<p>Understanding the difference between malware, spyware, trojans, ransomware, scareware, and viruses is very important. For example, a computer virus is the most famous type of malware. <em>Malware</em> is short for malicious software or code and is used as a single term to refer to a virus, spyware, worm, and so on, written to disrupt, exploit, steal data, or disable computers over networks. It is important that all users know how to recognize and protect themselves from malware in all of its forms. By nature, computer viruses and worms spread by making copies of themselves. Most of us feel that a firewall does protect us from malware, but, in reality, normal stateful (we will discuss how stateful firewalls work in detail in the <a href="8f12cf3b-642b-4bef-a5ec-431ebeef98c9.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 10</a>, <em>Firewall Placement and Detection Techniques</em>) firewalls don't protect against malicious content on websites, but anti-malware protects servers and workstations. I would like to clarify here that next-generation firewalls come with antivirus and malware protection, but it has to be configured for the traffic you would like to inspect. You still need endpoint protection.</p>
<p>A robust antivirus software package is the primary layer of technological defenses that every personal and business computer system must have. Well-designed antivirus protection comes with several characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ransomware protection</li>
<li>Malware protection</li>
<li>Web security</li>
<li>Email security</li>
<li>Scan engine</li>
<li>Anti-keylogger</li>
</ul>
<div class="packt_infobox">The WannaCry ransomware outbreak infected millions of Windows based systems across the globe in May 2017. WannaCry searches for and encrypts 176 different file types. The ransom note indicates that the payment amount will be doubled after three days. If payment is not made after seven days, it claims that the encrypted files will be deleted. WannaCry has affected individuals, as well as government organizations, hospitals, and universities. You can finally remove WannaCry using an antivirus software, but unfortunately this doesn't magically decrypt your files owing to a strong combined encryption of AES-128 with the RSA-2048 being used.<br/>
To stay safe from WannaCry ransomware attacks, it's important to keep your software, especially your operating system, up to date. <span>It is recommended to install a second layer of protection through an endpoint antivirus package.</span></div>

<p>Local security polices are specific to local systems or machines. This makes it possible to enforce many systems, user- and security-related settings, such as password policies, audit policies and user permissions. Most of the default policy settings in Windows are okay, but a few need adjustments for enhanced security. These policies can be modified using the local group policy editor, which normally contains account policies, local policies, firewalls, security, and so on. On a Windows system, you can access the policy editor by running the <kbd>gpedit.msc</kbd> <span>command,</span><span> </span><span>using the Command Prompt.

<p>No matter how secure your network infrastructure is and no matter what services your server runs, there are certain basic hardening techniques you must apply. In this chapter, we focused specifically on hardening steps that apply to any server. In particular, we discussed the physical security of server resources, followed by disk encryption techniques one can use for on-premises and cloud infrastructure. We have established that almost every server has some sort of internet-facing connectivity and has to be protected by antivirus and malware solutions. To complement these security solutions, we can also harden our servers and adjust local security polices and permissions. Finally, we discussed some server management techniques to restrict access to a specific set of IP addresses for SSH and RDP services.</p>
