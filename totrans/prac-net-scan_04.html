<p>In the previous chapter, we looked at how to secure a server infrastructure inside a secure network. We also looked at the importance of taking server hardening into consideration before moving a system to a production environment. In this chapter, you will learn about the security concerns for cloud infrastructure. As a user, you are not going to manage or secure the physical infrastructure of the service provider for this. </p>
<p>The IT industry is going through a major transformation, and the adoption of cloud computing is clearly a strategic direction for many companies and individuals. This chapter lays out the foundations of cloud computing and provides you with a clear understanding of the topic before moving on to critical applications and migrating data to public cloud networks. Cloud computing offers many benefits, but there are disadvantages as well. It also introduces the difficulty of securing the data outsourced by cloud users. In this book, we will explore cloud security and risk issues in a generic sense.</p>
<p>We are going to cover the following topics in this chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cloud offerings</li>
<li>Public versus private</li>
<li>Shared technology and shared danger</li>
<li>Security approach for cloud computing</li>
<li>DOS attack protection</li>
<li>Data loss prevention</li>
<li>Exploited system vulnerabilities</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a small topic with a big debate surrounding it. This debate looks at which cloud model is right for business when an organization plans to migrate to the cloud. Cloud-based virtual infrastructure offers advantages over a traditional data center. Both private and public cloud models have their own sets of pros and cons. Any organization moving to the cloud must first carefully analyze these before deciding which method is right for them.</p>
<p>In this section, we will start by <span>looking </span><span>briefly</span><span> </span><span>at cloud offerings, with a focus on the security benefits for both types of service. The three main models of cloud computing are as follows:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Infrastructure as a service</strong> (<strong>IaaS</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>Platform as a service</strong> (<strong>PaaS</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>Software as a service</strong> (<strong>SaaS</strong>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The following diagram is self-explanatory. It displays cloud offerings and states which of these should be managed by a customer, and which should be managed by cloud service providers:</p>

<div class="packt_infobox">A true cloud service provider does not only offer virtualization in a highly automated environment, but the global presence of resources is what makes it a true cloud service provider. The global presence here is defined by user proximity and how close the user is to the service provider. For example, if I'm at a certain region called <em>A</em> and my cloud provider is also at <em>A</em>, then my user experience would be much better than other users who are at <em>B</em> or <em>C</em>. AWS/Azure has global presence to offer the resources needed to bring applications closer to end users around the world. A worldwide presence also enables consumers to specify the location in which their data will be stored.</div>

<p>IaaS is a highly automated cloud offering. Here, compute, storage, and networking capabilities are owned by the cloud service provider and services are offered to customers on-demand with self-provisioning IaaS infrastructures. This infrastructure uses a GUI interface or command-line that serves as a customer-managed console for the overall environment provisioning. Cloud users will have full administrator rights on virtual machines. The diagram below shows a typical IaaS model in which compute, networking, load-balancing and storage are provisioned by a cloud consumer:</p>

<p>PaaS is another offering of cloud computing that works in the middle layer between IaaS and SaaS, and facilitates runtime environment mostly for developers to build and test applications. With PaaS, instead of an end user requesting a VM from AWS or Azure, users can request an actual application and an underlying cloud infrastructure, including networks, servers, operating systems, storage, and security, managed by the cloud service provider. PaaS helps businesses to minimize operational costs and increase productivity by decreasing the time to market. PaaS users have a very common fear of vendor lock-in and the lack of portability when they want to switch between cloud service providers in the future. However, it is a standard offering by all cloud service providers to provide a common platform to avoid vendor lock-in situations. </p>

<p>SaaS cloud offering is easy to use and is one of the most popular forms of cloud computing. SaaS also uses a web-based delivery model. Most SaaS applications can be run directly from a web browser, without any downloads or installations required, which eliminates the need to install and run applications on individual compute machines. In simple terms, you are provided access to application services installed on a server. It becomes very easy for enterprises to focus on actual business instead of focusing on IT, because everything is managed by the cloud service provider: applications, runtime, data, middleware, O/S, virtualization, servers, storage, security, and networking. Gmail, Salesforce, and Office 365 are famous examples of SaaS services offered by Google, Salesforce, and Microsoft.</p>

<p>Choosing between public and private cloud models will depend on an organization's business model, budget, security, and compliance factors. Let's discuss some of the major differences between them.</p>
<p>A public cloud is basically the internet-based cloud computing platform. Examples of major public cloud providers include Amazon <strong>Elastic Compute Cloud</strong> (<strong>EC2</strong>) and Windows Azure Services platform. Since a public cloud uses shared infrastructure and a virtualized environment, multiple customers can use services simultaneously without interfering with each other's activities. It is a subscription-based, pay-per-usage model, and the only costs incurred are based on the capacity that is being used.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a private cloud solution <span>pretty much </span><span>provides the same cloud offerings, but infrastructure is deployed and operated exclusively for an organization or enterprise. The private cloud is also the preferred choice for organizations who depend on legacy applications, might experience poor performance when migrating to the public cloud, or might need to rewrite the entire application. </span></p>

<p>Now let's dig deeper and try to understand the difference between public and private clouds' individual offerings. IaaS components are pretty much defined by the public cloud service provider, and an end consumer has limited options for customizing OS templates, versions and standard configuration options. Service providers roll out standard offerings based on the need for a larger set of consumers and the need to minimize the number of variances for different components. On the other hand, a private cloud offers you the flexibility to customize service components to a much greater degree.</p>

<p>It is important for consumers of PaaS services to understand the pros and cons of both public and private PaaS before deciding to use a PaaS deployment model. A public PaaS runs on a shared infrastructure to host multi-tenant environments, whereas a private PaaS runs on an infrastructure that is used exclusively by an organization. A private PaaS is considered more secure, and it avoids business and technical risks that come with public cloud computing. The major concern behind choosing a private cloud is data security. This does not mean that your data is not secure within a public cloud, it simply means that sometimes data is not safe. For example, the banking sector does not host critical data on a public cloud. </p>

<p>Private SaaS are SaaS applications delivered on a single tenant architecture. These are hosted either on-premises or off-premises and always on a highly secure network. Application customization is the biggest benefit, as this is very limited with public SaaS. </p>

<p>Today, cloud computing is a well-established industry. It is cost-effective, highly agile and flexible, with the ability to provide on-demand, large web-scale cloud computing. Data security is a major concern with a common question: is moving data to the cloud secure or not? In most cases, data is secure. However, when it comes to the fear of losing critical data, organizations tend to opt for a private cloud.</p>
<p>Let's discuss how shared security works in a public cloud. The security implementation of major cloud providers is not the sole responsibility of a cloud service provider, but the shared responsibility of the provider and customer. A service provider is responsible for the underlying infrastructure, but resource access and application security is the responsibility of the customer. This is similar to a situation in which you have a big community with a main entrance secured by many guards. Once you allow a visitor inside the premises, the activity of the visitor becomes your responsibility. In our situation, i<span>f a vulnerability is found in Hypervisor, the service provider won't allow you to patch it. If a vulnerability is found in an operating system, the service provider won't patch for VM and the responsibility, therefore, transfers to the customer.</span></p>
<p>Network security is a major component of a multi-tenancy environment and strict isolation is a must. Cloud providers do provide a networking infrastructure base to build isolated networks, but they do not keep track of what kind of network traffic goes in and out. Infrastructure hardware and software vulnerabilities can cause major failure to maintain isolation between tenants. During the failure, if attackers gain access for one tenant, they can access resources for other tenants as well.</p>
<p>Another major threat exists with cloud consumer data. A consumer has less visibility of where the data was physically stored. A very simple example would be consumer data deletion. Tenant data may be stored on multiple physical hosts; those may be part of the same cluster or may not be. If the consumer opted for geo-redundancy, the data might be located in one region or may be spread across regions. The data deletion process may differ from one service provider to another and consumers have no mechanism to validate data deletion. There must be a chance that this data is available to the next tenant during storage provisioning otherwise attackers might gain access to the data.  </p>
<p>So far, we have discussed that threats are generic in nature. In multi-tenancy, a CPU can cause major risks when the CPUs are shared across multiple customers. Interesting, right? Let's discuss this in detail:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-410 image-border" src="Images/ee469b63-e531-4c3a-8c32-db629c449a9e.jpg" style="width:25.75em;height:26.17em;" width="595" height="604"/></div>
<p>Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities make data leaking possible for co-hosted tenants, which makes them particularly dangerous when a single device is shared between users. Cloud offers a separate instance to each customer; isolation is tight and has no way to jump from one instance to another. In this case, attackers extract data that is currently being processed directly from the processor for customers sharing the same chip. This might include your passwords stored in a password manager or browser, your personal photos, emails, instant messages, and even critical documents in business. The biggest worry arises when you are not sure if somebody has tried to steal your data. The exploitation does not leave any traces in traditional log files.</p>

<p>From on-premises to the cloud application transformation journey, consumers have lost visibility on many things. Network security does <em>not</em> offer consumers the visibility required for highly virtualized cloud networks. Cloud technology comes with a certain degree of uncertainty and fear. Relying on cloud to store large amounts of critical data with no network boundaries, less visibility and reduced security control, makes it difficult for administrators to see what's happening with applications and data. </p>
<p>Cloud revolves around data centers and its global presence. Consumers have a lack of visibility into underlying networks and the security infrastructure of a cloud provider. The biggest question for all cloud consumers is whether you are supposed to know about underlying cloud infrastructure builds. The answer to this would be <em>yes</em> and <em>no</em>. The answer would be <em>no</em> with regards to underlying network and security for underlying base infrastructure since you are not suppose to manage and control this. It would also be <em>yes</em> as you must have visibility with your pieces on logical infrastructure sitting on top of the physical infrastructure.</p>

<p>In traditional enterprise and hosting networks architecture, IT resources such as compute, firewall, storage, load balancer and WAN are fairly static and well-defined under boundaries with a greater degree of control. Network security teams implemented <strong><span>Security Information &amp; Event Management</span></strong> (<strong><span>SIEM</span></strong>), proper security zones, passive TAPs, net flow based solution and IDS/IPS tools to provide deeper insights into security threats occurring in their network environment:</p>

<p>This diagram displays the web servers, network devices, WAN/partner connectivity, and security architecture of a legacy network.

<ul>
<li>Fixed architecture and topology</li>
<li>Proprietary protocols</li>
<li>Inefficient use of infrastructure resources</li>

<p>The below diagram demonstrates what the hybrid data center looks like from a customer's point of view. In this case, most of your stuff is outside of the network boundaries of the organization, such as a SaaS, IaaS and PaaS, and your currently deployed security solution has lost visibility of an infrastructure deployed on the other side of the world. In terms of network visibility, an IaaS model is more flexible than SaaS. On the other hand, a SaaS model does not allow infrastructure visibility behind the cloud application:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-885 image-border" src="Images/bad94169-171f-43e4-9cc3-f7c637f22d83.png" style="width:44.25em;height:36.08em;" width="924" height="754"/></div>
<p>Let's take a look at what the cloud data center network looks like and why we lose total visibility for SaaS from a customer's point of view. Most big cloud service providers have a very agile and resilient fat-free network, which looks similar to the following diagram:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-886 image-border" src="Images/40bfcc03-1254-4b2a-8c26-e6768e5c48da.png" style="width:36.92em;height:26.33em;" width="903" height="642"/></div>
<p>In this cloud design, all networking functions like <span>firewall and load balancer</span> have been moved to a server layer by taking advantage of <strong>network function virtualization</strong> (<strong>NFV</strong>). While this design supports increasing East-West traffic, the legacy model was based on traditional client-sever (North-South) traffic. These servers are also shared resources and virtual machines are allocated to customers. From one VM to another VM, service provider can use either GRE or Vxlan encryption:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-887 image-border" src="Images/2d15ec7d-083d-48d5-9071-2fd57aab04d2.png" style="width:90.75em;height:33.25em;" width="1089" height="399"/></div>
<p>In this model, resources can reside anywhere on server clusters. As a customer, we do not have the control to choose physical resources. From ISP to L3 <strong>Top-of-Rack switch</strong> (<strong>TOR</strong>) and from one physical server to another, communication is encrypted and controlled by service provider, so you have no way of looking at network traffic. IaaS services provide an option to configure virtual appliances such as firewall virtual appliance and virtual TAP. These can provide some visibility, but SaaS is going to be an absolutely zero visibility zone.</p>

<p>Virtual appliances can be used to protect or to gain visibility for the customer's environment, specifically to IaaS. This has nothing to do with service provider's baseline environment.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at security layers offered to customers by Microsoft Azure. When it comes to inbound traffic from the internet, Azure DDoS is the first layer of security and helps us to protect against large-scale attacks against Azure customer resources. The next layer is customer-defined public IP addresses (endpoints). Some endpoints are standard and the rest can be defined by the customer, which is used to determine what traffic can pass through the cloud service (public IP) to the virtual network resource. Native Azure virtual network isolation ensures complete isolation from all other customer networks and also provides flexibility to reuse IP space. Network security group is the next layer, and this acts as a firewall access-list by user defined rules. Network virtual appliances is the final layer. This can be used to create security boundaries to protect the application deployments in the protected virtual network:</p>

<p>Multi-tier architecture is common practice for cloud applications. Virtual firewall appliance is a pre-installed software solution which runs on top of virtual machine. All incoming and outgoing traffic passes via firewall. It offers full visibility and better control. Customers can use these firewalls for the purpose of firewall controlled traffic and VPNs. </p>
<p>A typical deployment may look like the following diagram. These products can be chosen from the marketplace under <strong>BYOL</strong>. The major vendors are Cisco vASA, Barracuda, Palo Alto, and Check Point:</p>

<p>Let's take a look at Network Security Group, which is an Azure inbuilt feature. You can find this option in the <em>virtual machine networking</em> section:</p>

<p>You can also add/delete inbound or outbound traffic rules as per your requirement by mentioning different parameters, like source, destination, port range, protocol, action, and rule priority:</p>

<p>In a traditional network, you have options to TAP data traffic by applying some sort of TAP device or port mirroring (SPAN). Port mirroring creates a copy of packets being transferred between two nodes via a network device. In order to provide this functionality in the cloud, you must use tap-as-a-service. When enabled and configured it will allow the system administrator to run an IDS on his tenant network. Good examples of these solutions are Phantom TAP from Ixia and Gigamon1s GigaVue. Advanced virtual switches like Cisco 1000V also support SPAN port functionality.</p>

<p>DDoS attack is one of the top security concerns when you host your application on a public cloud. The gaming industry is mostly abused by DDoS. Since the responsibility of the public cloud is shared, service provider offers basic DDoS protection services free of cost and with customized services by profiling services, altering traffic patterns and providing a <span>telemetry </span><span>monitoring </span><span>view. </span></p>

<p><strong>Data Loss Prevention</strong> (<strong>DLP</strong>) is a process for protecting sensitive data at rest, in-transit, and on endpoints to reduce the likelihood of data theft or unauthorized exposure. On-premises backup techniques and processes that protect data in enterprise data centers don't extend to the public cloud <span>well</span><span>. Intentional or accidental deletion of sensitive data can create serious issues for organizations. Due to lack of visibility, customer data is always vulnerable to data loss. By encrypting data when you transfer it to a cloud or between cloud providers, you provide an extra layer of data protection security and reduce the risk of data loss.</span></p>
<p>These two tasks would be under major consideration for the Data Loss Prevention Strategy:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Automated backups of public cloud data</strong>: Backups of public cloud sensitive data are extremely important and should be highly automated with proper encryption.</li>
<li><strong>Deletion control and validation</strong>: If data deletion validation fails, this can have disastrous consequences with subsequent data loss due to lack of visibility. You must have a way to detect and show that data has been deleted either accidental or intentionally. Multi-factor authentication and strict access should be in place to prevent unauthorized access for sensitive data.</li>
</ul>

<p>When moving to cloud computing, you have to consider the following security issues in order to enhance your data safety.</p>
<p>Session riding attack works based on session cookies and takes advantage of the user's previously authenticated session. Account hijacking or session riding is not new to cloud service providers and users. Hackers manage to gain access to login credentials and can easily track user activities. A similar attack occurs when attackers access cloud drive files without user credentials. This type of attack works by stealing the password token via a phishing attack or drive-by-exploit, a small file that sits on a user's device for convenience (saving the user from entering their password each time). Once attackers gain access, they can access and steal files, and even add malware or ransomware to the victim's cloud folder, which can be used for further attacks.</p>
<div class="packt_tip"><kbd>Https://</kbd> does not protect from session riding attacks.</div>
<p>Cloud-based DDoS attacks are a big threat now that it's very easy to turn thousands of VMs on and off quickly. Attackers do not launch such attacks from one service provider and one location—the intensity of the attack would be very high if machines are spread over multiple locations with each generating traffic towards the victim. Service providers also have detection mechanisms to detect unusual traffic, so the chance of getting caught is very high if a high volume of attacks are launched from one service provider. Another type of attack is a brute force attack. This can be a very powerful attack if launched from cloud, which can test thousands of password per second and can even break SHA-1 hashes.</p>
<p>A <strong>Cloud Application Programming Interface</strong> (<strong>Cloud API</strong>) is a type of API, generally based on the <strong><span>Representational State Transfer</span></strong> (<strong><span>REST</span></strong>) that enables the development of applications and services used for the provisioning of cloud hardware, software, and platforms. Cloud networks are typically put at risk by insecure or improper API. We have previously discussed system-specific vulnerabilities like <span>Meltdown and Spectre.</span></p>

<p>Cloud computing is the fastest growing computing model and is widely adopted by enterprise. According to Forbes, 83% of enterprise workloads will be in the cloud by 2020. Cloud offers the ability to ease software development, dynamic server provisioning and on-demand IT resources with greater flexibility. This changes the IT operating models for organizations. Data security is a crucial part for organizations that have moved data to public cloud or are planning on deploying applications in the future. In this chapter, we have discussed different offerings by cloud computing and what you should know as part of cloud data security. We have also discussed security considerations for cloud shared infrastructure and shared responsibilities between cloud customer and cloud service provider. In the last section we have covered how to gain lost data on wire visibility and on cloud shared infrastructure.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will discuss application security considerations before you launch an application for production and public access.</p>
