    cloud computing is clearly a strategic direction for many companies and individuals.
    This chapter lays out the foundations of cloud computing and provides you with
    a clear understanding of the topic before moving on to critical applications and
    migrating data to public cloud networks. Cloud computing offers many benefits,
    but there are disadvantages as well. It also introduces the difficulty of securing
    the data outsourced by cloud users. In this book, we will explore cloud security
    and risk issues in a generic sense.

    which cloud model is right for business when an organization plans to migrate
    to the cloud. Cloud-based virtual infrastructure offers advantages over a traditional
    data center. Both private and public cloud models have their own sets of pros

    AWS or Azure, users can request an actual application and an underlying cloud
    infrastructure, including networks, servers, operating systems, storage, and security,
    managed by the cloud service provider. PaaS helps businesses to minimize operational
    costs and increase productivity by decreasing the time to market. PaaS users have
    a very common fear of vendor lock-in and the lack of portability when they want
    to switch between cloud service providers in the future. However, it is a standard
    offering by all cloud service providers to provide a common platform to avoid

    business model, budget, security, and compliance factors. Let's discuss some of
    the major differences between them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A public cloud is basically the internet-based cloud computing platform. Examples
    of major public cloud providers include Amazon **Elastic Compute Cloud** (**EC2**)
    and Windows Azure Services platform. Since a public cloud uses shared infrastructure
    and a virtualized environment, multiple customers can use services simultaneously
    without interfering with each other's activities. It is a subscription-based,
    pay-per-usage model, and the only costs incurred are based on the capacity that
    is being used.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the other hand, a private cloud solution pretty much provides the same cloud
    offerings, but infrastructure is deployed and operated exclusively for an organization
    or enterprise. The private cloud is also the preferred choice for organizations
    who depend on legacy applications, might experience poor performance when migrating
    to the public cloud, or might need to rewrite the entire application.

    private clouds' individual offerings. IaaS components are pretty much defined
    by the public cloud service provider, and an end consumer has limited options
    for customizing OS templates, versions and standard configuration options. Service
    providers roll out standard offerings based on the need for a larger set of consumers
    and the need to minimize the number of variances for different components. On
    the other hand, a private cloud offers you the flexibility to customize service
    components to a much greater degree.

    of both public and private PaaS before deciding to use a PaaS deployment model.
    A public PaaS runs on a shared infrastructure to host multi-tenant environments,
    whereas a private PaaS runs on an infrastructure that is used exclusively by an
    organization. A private PaaS is considered more secure, and it avoids business
    and technical risks that come with public cloud computing. The major concern behind
    choosing a private cloud is data security. This does not mean that your data is
    not secure within a public cloud, it simply means that sometimes data is not safe.
    For example, the banking sector does not host critical data on a public cloud.

    it comes to the fear of losing critical data, organizations tend to opt for a
    private cloud.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's discuss how shared security works in a public cloud. The security implementation
    of major cloud providers is not the sole responsibility of a cloud service provider,
    but the shared responsibility of the provider and customer. A service provider
    is responsible for the underlying infrastructure, but resource access and application
    security is the responsibility of the customer. This is similar to a situation
    in which you have a big community with a main entrance secured by many guards.
    Once you allow a visitor inside the premises, the activity of the visitor becomes
    your responsibility. In our situation, if a vulnerability is found in Hypervisor,
    the service provider won't allow you to patch it. If a vulnerability is found
    in an operating system, the service provider won't patch for VM and the responsibility,
    therefore, transfers to the customer.

- en: Network security is a major component of a multi-tenancy environment and strict
    isolation is a must. Cloud providers do provide a networking infrastructure base
    to build isolated networks, but they do not keep track of what kind of network
    traffic goes in and out. Infrastructure hardware and software vulnerabilities
    can cause major failure to maintain isolation between tenants. During the failure,
    if attackers gain access for one tenant, they can access resources for other tenants
    as well.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another major threat exists with cloud consumer data. A consumer has less visibility
    of where the data was physically stored. A very simple example would be consumer
    data deletion. Tenant data may be stored on multiple physical hosts; those may
    be part of the same cluster or may not be. If the consumer opted for geo-redundancy,
    the data might be located in one region or may be spread across regions. The data
    deletion process may differ from one service provider to another and consumers
    have no mechanism to validate data deletion. There must be a chance that this
    data is available to the next tenant during storage provisioning otherwise attackers
    might gain access to the data.

- en: Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities make data leaking possible for co-hosted
    tenants, which makes them particularly dangerous when a single device is shared
    between users. Cloud offers a separate instance to each customer; isolation is
    tight and has no way to jump from one instance to another. In this case, attackers
    extract data that is currently being processed directly from the processor for
    customers sharing the same chip. This might include your passwords stored in a
    password manager or browser, your personal photos, emails, instant messages, and
    even critical documents in business. The biggest worry arises when you are not
    sure if somebody has tried to steal your data. The exploitation does not leave
    any traces in traditional log files.

    have lost visibility on many things. Network security does *not* offer consumers
    the visibility required for highly virtualized cloud networks. Cloud technology
    comes with a certain degree of uncertainty and fear. Relying on cloud to store
    large amounts of critical data with no network boundaries, less visibility and
    reduced security control, makes it difficult for administrators to see what's
    happening with applications and data.

    lack of visibility into underlying networks and the security infrastructure of
    a cloud provider. The biggest question for all cloud consumers is whether you
    are supposed to know about underlying cloud infrastructure builds. The answer
    to this would be *yes* and *no*. The answer would be *no* with regards to underlying
    network and security for underlying base infrastructure since you are not suppose
    to manage and control this. It would also be *yes* as you must have visibility

    the chance of getting caught is very high if a high volume of attacks are launched
    from one service provider. Another type of attack is a brute force attack. This
    can be a very powerful attack if launched from cloud, which can test thousands
    of password per second and can even break SHA-1 hashes.

    generally based on the **Representational State Transfer** (**REST**) that enables
    the development of applications and services used for the provisioning of cloud
    hardware, software, and platforms. Cloud networks are typically put at risk by
    insecure or improper API. We have previously discussed system-specific vulnerabilities
    like Meltdown and Spectre.

- en: Cloud computing is the fastest growing computing model and is widely adopted
    by enterprise. According to Forbes, 83% of enterprise workloads will be in the
    cloud by 2020\. Cloud offers the ability to ease software development, dynamic
    server provisioning and on-demand IT resources with greater flexibility. This
    changes the IT operating models for organizations. Data security is a crucial
    part for organizations that have moved data to public cloud or are planning on
    deploying applications in the future. In this chapter, we have discussed different
    offerings by cloud computing and what you should know as part of cloud data security.
    We have also discussed security considerations for cloud shared infrastructure
    and shared responsibilities between cloud customer and cloud service provider.
    In the last section we have covered how to gain lost data on wire visibility and
    on cloud shared infrastructure.
