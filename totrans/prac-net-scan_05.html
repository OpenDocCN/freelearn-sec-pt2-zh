<p class="mce-root">In the previous chapter, we discussed data protection and security techniques for cloud hosted applications. In this chapter, we will discuss application security for web-based applications.  </p>
<p>While applications can provide efficiency, risks still remain. This is a result of the fact that there are a number of new security threats which could potentially pose significant risks to an organization's IT infrastructure. It is essential to understand the vulnerabilities commonly found in various applications and provide users with a better experience. In this chapter, we will focus on the security aspect of web-based applications with <strong>General Data Protection Regulation</strong> (<strong>GDPR</strong>) around the corner.</p>
<p class="mce-root">We are going to cover the following topics in this chapter:</p>

<p>In a digital transformation era, customers' sensitive personal information held by business organizations pose a significant risk if they are stolen and misused. The data protection laws across the globe have a common goal to protect the privacy of individuals. The general data protection regulation was introduced, which specifies how customer data should be used and protected. Most of us share our personal information on many web portals by clicking <span class="packt_screen">I Agree</span> or <span class="packt_screen">I Accept</span><span class="packt_screen"> the Terms and Conditions</span>. Personal data contains information about the individual, including who they are, what they do, and where they go. Each of us leaves a digital footprint of our personal data in the cyber world. Data mining is new oil to the industry; it provides insights and a competitive advantage.</p>
<p>The GDPR compliance deadline is May 25, 2018. Every organization that keeps or uses European personal data inside or outside of Europe—regardless of the nature of the business in which it operates—is affected by the new data protection law.</p>
<p>Let's look at an example of how this impacts organizations worldwide.</p>
<p>A US organisation which collects data from EU personnel would be under the same legal obligations as the organisation's head-office which is anywhere within the EU. Even though they do not have an actual physical server or office in the EU, the basic idea was that if the data was <span>not</span><span> </span><span>physically located in the EU zone, then the rules didn't even apply. For example, any social networking portal has to keep user information and if the user belongs to the EU, the information is stored on a server which is outside of EU boundaries.</span></p>
<p>Legislation has to be enforced by 25th May 2018 and this may result in huge penalties for organizations that fail to comply. The maximum penalty is €20 million or 4% of an organization's global turnover. This amount would be enough to close down many businesses. To avoid these steep consequences, preparation is the key to success.</p>

<p>Consent is a key factor of GDPR legislation, which offers individuals a choice and control over how their data is used, with a desire to build their trust and engagement. Your web-portal which collects personal data must make visitors understand exactly how you are planning on using their personal information. They must then agree to each specific purpose. Even if you have someone's email address, phone number, and credit card information after they use a shopping cart feature, you are not allowed to share this information without their agreement. </p>

The first thing to understand <span>is</span><span> </span><span>who these entities are and if they have a valid reason to get access to this data.

<p>SQL Injection is one of the <span>oldest</span><span> and most </span><span>widely used application layer vulnerabilities used by attackers to steal valuable data from SQL based databases. Attackers leverage an SQL Injection vulnerability to bypass a web application's authentication system and to retrieve information. SQL Injection can also be used to make changes like adding, deleting, and modifying data records. The following diagram shows a 3-Tier application architecture:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-890 image-border" src="Images/3f6891e5-a423-46bc-97d7-5f8e58587090.png" style="width:30.42em;height:25.58em;" width="757" height="637"/></div>
<p>The 3-Tier application has the following components: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>User Interface</strong>: <strong>User Interface</strong> (<strong>UI</strong>) is basically a user friendly way to interact with an actual application. This can be a mobile application, web UI or API method to interact with applications. A UI layer requests data from a business layer.</li>
<li><strong>Business Logic</strong>: A business logic can be considered an application layer which is responsible for handling data validation, business rules and task-specific behavior. Business rules fetch or insert data into the database layer. </li>
<li><strong>Database Layer</strong>: This is the third and most critical layer of the 3-Tiers, which hosts the actual data and is responsible for feeding data to the other above-mentioned two layers.</li>
</ul>
<div class="packt_infobox">It's worth mentioning here that running a SQLi attack against a website without the owner's permission could well land you in legal trouble with the state law enforcement.</div>
<p>Let's discuss how SQLi works in detail:</p>
<ul>
<li class="mce-root"><span>On a web portal login page, when you submit a username and password, the SQL query will look like the following. If the correct credentials have been provided, everything will work fine:</span></li>
</ul>
<pre style="color: black;padding-left: 60px">SELECT id FROM customer_data WHERE username = 'xyz' AND password ='abcd';</pre>
<ul>
<li>The same method becomes vulnerable due to a small trick which bypasses the login forms on web portals:</li>
</ul>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px" class="mce-root">SELECT id FROM customer_data WHERE username = '' AND password = '' OR '1'='1'';</pre>
<p class="mce-root">You can see that the username field is empty and the password field has a closed apostrophe. The magic starts here with the <kbd>OR</kbd> statement <kbd>'1'= '1'</kbd> which will always return true and the whole query returns all <kbd>username</kbd> and <kbd>password</kbd> from the entire database.</p>
<p>We have discussed the basic idea of what an SQL Injection is and how it works. The preceding example is a very basic attack that can run very complicated queries to crack databases. It is highly recommended to test the system or a website with databases against this type of attack every time it is launched for public access. Just think, if you can play tricks with a banking system which is vulnerable to SQLi, you can probably rob the bank by manipulating the amount reflected on your account or by transferring an amount to someone else.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Do remember that this SQL Injection test should only be tested in the test environment.</div>

<p>It is very important for all websites to filter all user inputs and to exploit works because of weak input filtering or no filtering at all. You can also call this <em>validation</em>. For example, if the input field is supposed to be a cell phone number, you can certainly validate that field to make sure that it contains only numbers and, of course, is the length of a cell phone number. This will not just protect your application from SQLi but it will also protect you from undesired behavior. </p>

<p><strong>Web Application Firewalls</strong> (<strong>WAFs</strong>) are essential security mechanisms used on almost all commercial websites today. Using a WAF is a very effective way of preventing known attacks. The WAF combats commonly known attacks against web servers using a number of security checks to filter inbound HTTP/HTTPS requests. In addition to managing requests, you can apply WAF security checks to modify the responses sent back to users. Despite the excellent protection they offer against many types of attacks, WAF is inadequate for protecting against today's sophisticated <strong>SQL Injection</strong> (<strong>SQLi</strong>) attacks. You can consider WAF a rule-based second layer of defense for protecting web servers against known threats XSS, SQLi, and DDoS attacks.</p>

To limit database privileges, create multiple database user accounts with a minimum level of privilege for their usage environments.

<p>Once you have written your application, we do not know if it is vulnerable to SQL Injection. Obviously, you could examine the source code and find any instances of concatenating user input with SQL, but that could be very tedious and time consuming. You must use a good, updated vulnerability scanner to find the most frequently found vulnerabilities. Performing SQL Injection generates high network bandwidth and sends a lot of data, so make sure you are the owner of the website you are testing. If not, make sure you have taken prior permission from the owner. A few famous tools such as sqlmap, Acunetix, Vega, and Netsparker can be used for scanning.</p>

<p>WAFs provide additional security between users and web applications to protect web servers from unauthorized access and malicious attacks. WAF vendors offer hardware, software, virtual, and cloud-based firewall solutions. Web applications are extremely vulnerable and are also the backbone of business, so they must be protected. The biggest challenge in application security is detecting a vulnerability in your application, at which point the trouble begins when you are patching and fixing the code, as these are time-consuming tasks. This is where WAFs come in; as soon as a vulnerability is detected, you can apply patches to WAF. Any request which comes after the WAF patches are updated will stop attacks associated with the vulnerability that has been found. </p>
<p>Let's take a look at the following diagram. Non-HTTP/HTTPS attacks are blocked by a perimeter firewall, but the perimeter firewall does allow HTTP/HTTPS connections. These HTTP/HTTPS connections can also become attacks and are therefore blocked by WAF, which acts as a second layer of security. Consequently, only a clean connection is passed by both layers and reaches the application server:</p>

<p>A simple approach and fundamental principle in IT security is to allow what is really needed. Security is all about access control and keeping track of activity with identity. In cyber security, access is granted based on identity and intent. Whitelists are identities with good intent and blacklists are identities with bad intent. This is a debatable topic and we will discuss it further with regards to requirements and implementation:</p>

<p>Most of the antivirus suites on the market work with a blacklist approach to detecting and preventing viruses and malware. In the 1980s, antivirus was first introduced with blacklist. Today, the antivirus industry still follows the same principle. This works similar to creating a list of all cyber criminals in the world. However, what happens if you miss a few criminals, or if they are new and are not on the list? Depending on the IT environment, blacklisted entities might extend to users, applications, processes, IP addresses, and organizations known to carry threats to an individual or other organization.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>The primary advantage of blacklisting is its simplicity. You can exclude known threats from the system and the intelligence lies with the software vendor. Its effectiveness totally depends on how often the vendor releases or updates the known threat database. From a user's point of view, all of the updates are fetched automatically. Users do not have an option to differentiate between good and bad data traffic until the software says it's bad. The major drawback of blacklisting architecture is knowing how to deal with unknown threats. For example, ransomware continues to evolve with new patterns and variants that have not been seen before.  </p>

<p>Application whitelisting uses the reverse logic. Here, you can create a list of trusted entities such as applications, emails, users, trusted partners, services and IPs. These are allowed to access IT resources and block everything which seems to be unwanted for your business. With whitelisting architecture, you must have a tight access control policy and grant appropriate permission to users. Since you block all unwanted entities, this reduces the attack surface which gives automatic protection from zero-day attacks.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>The primary goal of whitelisting is to protect high-risk security environments. This approach only allows trusted software, applications, users and IPs, which drastically reduces intrusion. The main advantage is that nothing comes inside the network which is outside of the list, and nothing that is not on the list can come inside the network. A good example would be the way the salesforce application portal operates. With this, you gain access to an application only for the allowed IP range and users. We all know that salesforce is a critical application. This does not scale well for a large network or every time you need to add new entries, making it tough to manage.</p>

<p>Each approach to security has its advantages and disadvantages. It may sound strange, but you need both. A typical business organization which uses a limited number of applications and knows about the users and network connections required for this application should follow a whitelisting approach. The next step is to combine this approach with blacklisting to ensure that if authorized users enter the network with a known threat, your network will still be protected. Of course, there is less of an administrative effort involved in blacklisting compared to whitelisting, and the difference increases with the size of the whitelist. You can take a whitelist approach for applications which can be opened from all over the world, such as banking web portals and online shopping carts.</p>

This is because in today's world, there is no such thing as non-sensitive web traffic. </span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Beginning in July 2018 with the release of Chrome 68, Chrome will mark all HTTP sites as <em>not secure</em>.</div>
<p>HTTPS is a very serious and sensitive subject, and in this section we will discuss website security.</p>

<p><span><strong>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</strong> (</span><strong>HTTP</strong>) is a protocol that allows communications between client and server. Most commonly, it is used for transferring data from a web server to a browser to view web contents. The main problem is that HTTP does not encrypt the data being transmitted and can be snooped by someone else. As the first part of the diagram shows, a web server running on service port <kbd>80</kbd> and all the content being transferred between client and server are in plain text. In the next section of the diagram, the web service is running on the service port <kbd>443</kbd> and data is being transferred in encrypted mode:</p>

<p>HTTPS is the secure form of HTTP, which simply means that the information being exchanged between the browser and web server you are visiting is encrypted. Any web servers currently using HTTP can be migrated to HTTPS. However, there is a small cost if a <strong><span>Secure Sockets Layer</span></strong> (<strong><span>SSL</span></strong>) certificate must be purchased. HTTPS helps to prevent attackers from hijacking communication sessions between your web-server and user browsers when using public infrastructures such as public Wi-Fi, ISPs, or hotels.</p>

<p>It is always preferable to have longer key lengths, but for public-key cryptography (asymmetric ciphers), 2048-bit keys have the same sort of property, so longer keys are meaningless. <strong>National Institute of Standards and Technology</strong> (<strong>NIST</strong>) suggests that a 2048-bit RSA key has a strength of 112 bits, therefore there are theoretically two thousand, one hundred and twelve possibilities to crack the private key. RSA claims that 1024-bit (asymmetric) keys are likely to be cracked sometime between 2006 and 2010, and 2048-bit keys are sufficient until 2030. At the same time, longer key sizes like 4096 <span>significantly </span><span>decrease server performance, which directly impacts browser response time.</span></p>

<p><strong>Secure Hash Algorithm</strong> (<strong>SHA</strong>) is a hashing algorithm used in secured connections to provide the integrity and authenticity of a message to the receiver. SHA algorithm is the default hash algorithm set in SSL/TLS certificates. SHA-2 is a set of hash functions including SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256. The most common hash function used is SHA-256. Generally speaking, SHA-2 = SHA-256 and that is the minimum requirement.</p>

<p>Authentication plays a very critical role in the security of web applications. Attackers will try to find passwords or session IDs and get access to the desired information. Here are a few ways to prevent an authentication hacking attack:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prevent an automated brute force attack by adding CAPTCHA. However, this is not perfect. Along with CAPTCHA, use account lock-down. This is a very effective deterrent against brute force attacks.</li>
<li>Transfer session keys in cookies (do not show session IDs in the URL) and session keys should be unpredictable. Showing session IDs with the URL is a method that is normally used when cookies are blocked by client side or a fallback method.</li>
<li>Keep the duration shorter for session IDs and ensure that they are rejected by the server after logout.</li>
<li>Use two-factor authentication.</li>
<li>During a session fixation, the attacker wants you to access your account with a Session ID of his choosing. An easy fix for this problem is to not let a client choose session IDs.</li>
<li>Do not leave your session active once you are done with your activity; ensure that you log out at the end of every session. Session logout also forces attackers to log out automatically.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cookies are a set of information stored on the client browser, which are then sent to the server with every subsequent request made by the client during the session. Cookies are primarily used for authentication and maintaining sessions. It becomes very important to secure cookies effectively in order to avoid session hijacking. Cookies can be secured by properly setting cookie attributes. These attributes are:</p>
<ul>
<li class="mce-root">Secure</li>
<li class="mce-root">Domain</li>
<li class="mce-root">Path</li>
<li class="mce-root">HTTPOnly</li>
<li class="mce-root">Expires</li>
</ul>
<p>A developer only encrypts the main login page. Other sensitive and non-sensitive information is sent to the server in an unencrypted format. Keep in mind that cookies are also sent along with these requests. If they are unencrypted then this gives an attacker the opportunity to sniff data to steal session information from these cookies. To avoid leaking session information to attackers, make sure that the cookies are also only transmitted over HTTPS connections, not HTTP connections. This can be done with the help of the secure attribute of a cookie. You can also play with all other attributes such as HTTPOnly. This protects you from XSS cross site scripting, which can steal data from cookies.</p>

<p>With the adoption of digital transformation by businesses and organizations, web applications have become a lucrative target for attackers. Web applications are often plagued by vulnerabilities and misconfigurations due to poor coding and broken hardening policies. Network and security admins must use web application security scanners to perform testing on a web application and identify security vulnerabilities. Scanners do not access the actual source code, they only perform functional testing and try to find security vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>By now, you are familiar with the basics of application security. We have covered enough background information in this chapter to understand a multi-layer security approach. Although web applications can efficiently exchange information, the fact still remains that these applications can be attacked. A number of new security threats have also arisen. If not handled properly, these issues could potentially pose significant risks to an organization's information technology infrastructure. Since it is all about data security, individual data is very important. Consequently, it becomes very important for organizations to design a robust web system aligned with GDPR to protect users' information.</p>
<p class="mce-root">In the next chapter, we will discuss an overall approach for infrastructure security and future technology.</p>
