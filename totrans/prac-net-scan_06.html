<p>In the previous chapter, you<span> learned how to identify the common risks involved when designing and launching an application. You also learned the common safeguarding methods to help users to surf applications securely.</span></p>
<p>In a hyperconnected world, responding to cyber threats is the new reality for organizations and security professionals. In this chapter, we will explore the basics of threat detection and ways to mitigate ongoing threats. Finally, you will learn to choose and deploy an advanced threat protection system for your business goals. The typical network contains information about users and also includes security information. A critical step towards protecting your organization includes having end-to-end visibility into usual and unusual traffic patterns, URL scanning, blocked traffic, ranking-based websites during visits to malicious websites, detecting botnets, DDoS protection, and defense against unknown threats.</p>
<p>We will cover the following topics in this chapter: </p>
<ul>
<li>Network threat detection</li>
<li>Endpoint threat detection</li>
<li>Security information and event management</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to protect information, organizations need to change the way they think. Administrators need to stop thinking that the firewall, IPS, IDS, and antivirus suites will be able to protect their system from all types of cyber threats. Most traditional security detection models are old and outdated and even they cannot differentiate between malware and regular network traffic. An organization's data security programs can ideally stop a majority of known threats. However, there are many <em>unknown, evil</em> threats that an organization aims to detect and has not encountered before. This can be a result of brand new methods and technologies.</p>

<p>Network intrusion detection systems themselves are not perfect, and are always bombarded with both false positive and false negative notifications and warnings. Consequently, any threat detection system needs both a human element and a technical element. The human element may come in with security analysts who analyze trends, data traffic patterns, behaviors, and reports, as well as those who can determine if anomalous data indicates a potential threat or a false warning.</p>
<p><span>Let's take a look at different methods.</span></p>

<p>An <strong>intrusion detection system</strong> (<strong>IDS</strong>) is a type of signature-based software designed to monitor or scan network traffic to find suspicious activity and trigger alerts when something is trying to compromise an information system through malicious activities or security policy violations. Alerting information contains information about the source address of the intrusion, the target/victim address, and the type of attack that is suspected. An IDS is referred to as attack detection technology, but it cannot prevent or stop attacks. In contrast, an IPS device can be used to  prevent attacks by detecting them and stopping them proactively before they reach a target.</p>

<p>Intrusion detection systems can be further divided into two broad categories based on their placement: host-based IDSes and network-based IDSs.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS)</strong>: This is a small, agent or sensor-based piece of software installed on single or multiple hosts on a network. It protects the individual host by monitoring and reporting the system configuration and by keeping track of application activity. A host IDS is passive in nature, provides functionality to gather information by identifying, logging, alerting, and reporting. You can always install a HIDS on different DMZ servers such as web servers, mail servers, database servers, or any server that you want to monitor or protect on the network. Any masking techniques such as insertion, padding, fragmentation, or out-of-sequence delivery bypass a network-based IDS but can be easily caught by a host-based IDS. The primary goal of any HIDS is to monitor and analyze data traffic passing through the <strong>network interface card</strong> (<strong>NIC</strong>) of a host, but can also be expanded to monitor application behavior and activities.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Network-based intrusion detection system (NIDS)</strong>: This offers a different approach and monitors activity on the overall network traffic, rather than on each separate individual host. NIDS operations are based on the concept of wiretapping and the system comes with known attack signatures, which can also be customized. Signature updates are released by vendors from time to time. The major issue with NIDS is performance. For small organizations, this might be a suitable solution that deals with gigabytes of traffic. However, for larger organizations with high speed networks, it simply cannot handle it:</li>

<p>The IP traffic within a network can be sniffed by deploying network TAPs on a network and redirecting traffic via a network TAP or SPAN port to a security analyzer. The following diagram demonstrates the process of traffic travelling from a router and a switch into the network TAP. From there, it is directed to a port which hosts a network sniffer analyzer. This method provides full visibility into all network flows that reside in the network. One of the biggest advantages of network TAPs is their ability to monitor traffic without any interference.</p>
<p>However, there are also disadvantages. This includes the fact that the deployment of TAP is disruptive and expensive in nature, and can be difficult to manage for large scale networks. Significant expenses can be incurred as a result of the <span>security analyzer used to correlate all packet captures, to identify and mitigate security attacks, </span><span>the network TAP's deployment, and data storage</span><span>. These significant expenses derive from a number of physical links in any given network topology. </span></p>

<p>Network TAPs can be divided into two categories :</p>
<ul>
<li class="mce-root"><strong>Passive TAP</strong>:<strong> </strong>Passive TAPs are passive devices that make a copy of the network data and distribute it to a third-party appliance that is passing between network nodes.</li>
<li class="mce-root"><strong>Active TAP</strong>:<strong> </strong>It is what occurs on the inside of the TAP, which makes the difference.<strong> </strong>Active TAPs are used in networks where copper cabling or optical budgets do not allow for passive TAPs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Installing a TAP generally involves some network downtime, and this downtime could be increased if there are problems with a TAP.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>When looking at cloud scale and high speed data networks, the trend is to monitor and trigger events for suspicious flows based on NetFlow and <strong>IP Flow Information Export</strong> (<strong>IPFIX</strong>). Most network devices, routers/switches, and firewalls support NetFlow and IPFIX. These flow methods make the data traffic passing through devices visible. You can relate these methods to Wireshark capture, which holds information such as source IP, destination IP, and TCP/UDP ports. Wireshark capture works in a similar way to a phone call recording, while flows are the call logs containing metadata information. A flow reporting system continuously monitors flows and has the ability to connect host reputation databases in order to check any odd traffic patterns:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-655 image-border" src="Images/6895eb0a-f35b-42dd-83b8-c55254636ebf.png" style="width:151.92em;height:95.58em;" width="1823" height="1147"/></div>
<p>On a Cisco router, this configuration can be done for NetFlow v9. Before the release of NetFlow v9, flows were limited to roughly 20 common fields and the rest of the packet contents were discarded. The introduction to NetFlow v9 made it possible for data export logic to be used for any details found within a packet:</p>
<pre> match ipv4 protocol<br/> match ipv4 source address<br/> match ipv4 destination address<br/> match transport source-port<br/> match transport destination-port<br/> match interface input<br/> collect routing source as<br/> collect routing destination as<br/> collect transport tcp flags<br/> collect interface output<br/> collect counter bytes<br/> collect counter packets</pre>
<p>Let's assume that you are exporting TCP flag information along with traffic flow, and you also know the source and destination for network flows. Having this information makes it easy to detect SYN (a TCP flag) attacks. With flow technologies, cyber threat detection focuses primarily on monitoring traffic behavior rather than performing DPIs (such as a firewall) and triggering events based on a threat signature match. DPI methods do not scale very well for large infrastructures, such as cloud service providers, in which traffic comes in Tera/Peta bits per second.  Due to a lack of traffic handling capabilities, this makes it almost impossible to scan all traffic with expensive equipment, such as firewall and IPS systems. </p>

<p>First of all, IPFIX is an enhanced version of NetFlow v9, widely considered as NetFlow v10. IPFIX is an IETF standard specifically designed to make it easier to open up flow to a broad range of vendors. </p>
<p>As you may already know, IPFIX RFC 5101 and RFC 5102 are derived from the NetFlow v9 RFC. IPFIX is also backward compatible with v9, which was fuelled by vendors' desire to move away from Cisco-driven standards. This essentially allows hardware vendors to specify a vendor ID, to put any proprietary information into a flow, and to export it out of the collector/analyser for further dissecting and monitoring. NetFlow v9 now supports Flexible NetFlow, which is almost equal to IPFIX. By default, IPFIX listens on UDP port <kbd>4739</kbd>, while NetFlow v9 listens on 2055, 2056, 4432, 4739, 9995, 9996, and others. NetFlow v9 defines 79 field types and IPFIX defines the same 79, but continues on to reach 238. </p>

<p>Regardless of how powerful your defenses are, there's always a chance that attackers will evade your security system and gain access to your environment. Endpoint security generally refers to a well‐described method for protecting an organization's data and networks that are accessed by endusers and connected devices. Laptops and desktops are not the only devices that are considered to be endpoints; smartphones and other wireless devices also have network access that becomes a target and entry point for security threats. </p>

<p>An endpoint is any connected device used to access an organization's data and network resources. Looking at how to handle endpoint devices in order to safeguard the data assets that can be accessed through these systems is a challenging job for security administrators. </p>
<p>This becomes more complicated for security administrators when you allow employees to <strong>Bring Your Own Device</strong> (<strong>BYOD</strong>). Futuristic technology such as IoTs are also considered as endpoints.</p>
<p>The following diagram shows a hierarchy for different types of assets found in any organization network. The bottom-to-top approach reflects device counts and business values in terms of risk. As far as the counts are concerned, there are more end-user devices than anything else among the endpoints, with relatively fewer network devices and business-critical endpoints:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-657 image-border" src="Images/67cf9b6d-a62f-45a1-8e2d-1f6082714541.png" style="width:41.08em;height:35.75em;" width="1434" height="1248"/></div>
<p>From a business point of view, the pyramid shows a risk of being compromised. Devices at the bottom of the pyramid are more vulnerable to serious threats, and this opens the door for an attacker to move toward high level assets. The higher an attacker climbs on the pyramid, the bigger the impact is.</p>

<p>Every point of network interaction is a potential part of the network attack surface. Endpoint security simply involves hardening devices to reduce the attack surface and limiting network attack vectors. <strong>Endpoint Detection and Response</strong> (<strong>EDR</strong>) is a critical part of the overall security strategy, which addresses the need for continuous monitoring and responds to advanced threats. Securing endpoints starts with endpoint discovery as it is important to know what's on a network. The discovery of assets helps in building an inventory that includes firmware, OS, and many attributes. Security administrators can now assign the appropriate security policies to endpoints, and they can continue monitoring to help with any policy violations, unwanted changes, and unauthorized access:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/c3d6b5c3-15a3-448d-abee-fd699209ea5e.png" style="width:36.33em;height:21.58em;" width="748" height="446"/></div>
<p>EDR systems can also be lightweight programs called agents that run on each endpoint in the form of an application. They may even run in the form of a kernel‐level plugin on devices that may not support hosting applications directly. For some scenarios, an agentless approach can also be used. An agent provides real‐time monitoring for data traffic passing through NIC, analyze, and alert. Your endpoints can be hosted on an on-premise network such as an enterprise data center. They may also be hosted on a cloud network using a variety of devices such as virtual desktop or a wide range of operating systems such as Amazon Web Services and Azure deployments. </p>

<p><strong>Endpoint Detection and Response</strong> (<strong>EDR</strong>) solutions are essentially a Next-Generation set of security tools which focus on monitoring, detecting, investigating, and mitigating malicious activities as well as possible attacks on endpoints, beyond the legacy signature-based approach used in traditional security tools. </p>
<p>Let's take a look at one example of where the EDR system can help:</p>
<p><span>An online shopping company's <strong>Network Operating Center (NOC) </strong>started receiving alerts for 500 internal server error logs, with 10% of transactions resulting in failure. During</span> <span>initial </span><span>investigation, the NOC thought it was some sort of </span><span> DDoS attack, but their firewalls and </span><span>network intrusion detection system </span><span>events didn't report anything at all. T</span><span>hey then thought it was an exploited</span> system <span>vulnerability, but their vulnerability </span><span>scanner also reported nothing relevant to the event. </span><span>Finally, using EDR with configuration </span><span>management determined that an operating system update </span><span>patch had been deployed incorrectly </span><span>on four systems in a server farm of 20 servers </span><span>by looking at the system state history. </span><span>The patch was redeployed and </span><span>the error disappeared!</span></p>

<p>A security policy is a document which defines the plans to protect all type of assets, both physical and virtual. The following areas must be addressed:</p>
<ul>
<li class="mce-root">Risk assessment policy</li>
<li class="mce-root">Password policy</li>

<li class="mce-root">Internet policy</li>
<li class="mce-root">Disaster recovery</li>
<li class="mce-root">Intrusion detection</li>
</ul>
<p>Any violation of these policies should be monitored and prioritized for analysis and response. These can be used for the early detection of any security breach. Any organizations that seek to attain a high level of security maturity should review and adjust their endpoint security policies from time to time. </p>

<p>Increasingly, cyberattacks have been targeting organizations, resulting in multiple data breaches in recent years. Not only have these attacks increased in volume, but they have also become highly sophisticated in nature as well. These sophisticated new methods are much more complex and harder to find and stop. EDR differs from other <strong>endpoint protection platforms</strong> (<strong>EPP</strong>) such as antivirus (AV) and anti-malware, and its primary focus isn't just to automatically stop threats in the pre-execution phase of an endpoint. <span>The need for an EDR solution is the highest priority for any organization serious about business and that wants to ensure it is as protected from the threat of an attack. </span></p>
<p>There are many EDR solutions available on the market. However, capabilities may differ from platform to platform. When evaluating EDR platforms, you must consider capabilities including the level of visibility, reporting, automation, response effectiveness, ease of deployment, impact on the environment, and finally a solution that fits your budget.<br/>
Here are what organizations need to consider when choosing the right EDR solution:</p>
<ul>
<li class="mce-root">An EDR solution should run as a managed service based on complex analysis, and organizations need to have visibility into EDR operations and management. This might differ on the basis of whether the organization just needs prevention or if it also requires visibility.</li>
<li>Any viable EDR candidate must support all type of endpoints on their network.</li>
<li>Deploy tens or hundreds of thousands of endpoints quickly, in a scalable and cost effective way.</li>
<li>The solution should be intelligent enough to correlate activities across multiple endpoints.</li>
<li>The solution should not consume a significant portion of endpoint resources like bandwidth and CPU.</li>
<li>Finally, the cost of purchase and deployment, plus all recurring costs must fit within your security budget.</li>

<p>Understanding what's going on inside your network is the key element to securing it and ensuring continued surveillance. Managing the data feed coming from servers as well as security devices on activity and the use of these available services is key to providing this security. SIEM is a tool which aggregates incoming information from network sensors such as IPS, IDS, Honeypot, firewalls, or anything which can detect security events and feed information to the SIEM tool. SIEM provides you with the current state of your network and offers a 360-degree view of the IT environment. The correlation with log events makes it possible to view what is going on in your network, and including this feature means that an incident response team can react.</p>

<p>According to the <span><strong>National Institute of Standards and Technology</strong> </span>(<strong><span>NIST</span></strong>), "<em>Any observable occurrence in a system or network, such as sending an e-mail message, SSH to any device, or a firewall blocking an attempt to connect, are defined as an event</em>."</p>

<p>A security incident is an event that violates an organization’s security policies and procedures and compromises the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of information assets. For example, a simple login to an SSH server is considered an <strong>event</strong> but a brute force attack using multiple logins to an SSH server is considered a security incident. All types of security incidents should be actionable either in an automated way or by a security analyst.</p>

<p>Data breaches are the most the critical and confirmed security or privacy incident. These incidents may involve personal or business sensitive information. Storing sensitive data is always governed by the legal definition given by state laws. Data breaches also require notifying the affected individuals or users, regulatory agencies, sometimes credit reporting agencies, and the media.</p>

<p>Logs are the key and primary requirements for visualizing what's going on in your network and who's attacking. Every organization wants the logs coming from the all-critical resources of your network and business. As security administrator, you always want the logs from your firewall, IPS, and IDS. You will also want logs from your key servers sitting in DMZ, and of course you would also include Active Directory server and your key application, endpoint, and database servers. </p>

<p>Log collection or aggregation is the heart and soul of a SIEM solution. A SIEM should not be confused with SYSLOG data, which is a simple log generated by devices. Someone has to look at this log to find out the root cause of the alert. The idea is not only to collect log data, but to create a meaningful context from log data. SIEM platforms collect event logs from thousands of different sensors installed on various devices, and these events provide activity data, which is required to analyze the security of our IT environment. In order to get a 360-degree view, we need to consolidate what we collect onto a single platform to find out the pattern. Aggregation is the process of transformation for data transferring from different types of sources into a common repository and meaningful standard format.</p>
<p>For example, Event ID 10509 has resulted in login failure, and the logs are coming to the SIEM solution. It is very easy to read or correlate this event with an attack or an incident:</p>

<p>Event correlation is the process in which a SIEM relates a series of events to generate an incident or a more meaningful event. In our previous example, there were five failed login attempts to the same user account from multiple source machines. For a security analyst, it might be worth investigating this. Logging the correlation is the best way to raise alerts: </p>

<p>Alerting is a feature that enables SIEM systems to trigger alerts based on the rule configured. All solutions will at least alert the SIEM console, but some may offer extended alerting capabilities. </p>

<p>For massive SIEM deployment, a SIEM solution must have effective dashboards for compliance, infrastructure, and security analysis. Dashboards make it easier for security administrators to visualize a report on trends and activities, as well as to spot anomalies, to track security indicators, and to assess the overall security posture of an IT environment. Most SIEM products come with pre-built dashboards, but these can also be customized according to requirements.</p>

<p>Security professionals invest a lot of their time in running customized queries to get the required data. They also give a lot of time to navigating through multiple dashboards and data feeds just to find the details required to investigate a single alert. With an ever-growing number of cyberattacks, there comes the requirement to develop improved identification and response times to potential attacks and security threats.</p>
<p>To illustrate this, let's take a look at the following scenario:</p>
<p>It's a Saturday night, and you receive alerts for a malware infection like WannaCry in your IT environment. The first thing you do is try to remotely access your network, but for some reason this does not work. Do you have an alternative option? You could get changed, travel to the office and start checking IPS/IDS reports as well as analyzing security reports, but this might take a lot of time. Investing time in reports can cause more damage because such attacks spread quickly. Here, the easiest method is to isolate networks by shutting down devices or by unplugging the cables. But is that possible? Yes, but only if you have a small network with just a few racks of servers and a few networking gears. However, this approach is almost impossible for a large scale Geo-spread network.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Now imagine an automated incident response machine, which will raise an alarm as soon as malware is detected and will send you an SMS to your cell phone. Your SIEM solution will respond to such threats by isolating the infected machine from the network, and then peace will be restored when you recieve an SMS to notify you that the problem has been temporarily fixed in this way. When you return to the office on Monday, you can then analyze security reports and  recover your critical systems.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at a few more examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blocking a Malicious IP address</strong>: The first layer of security in any organization is a perimeter firewall. We know firewalls work according to rules, and this situation can be addressed by creating a new rule to block the malicious IP as soon as suspicious activity is detected. </li>
<li><strong>Node isolation</strong>: SIEM can automate vulnerability scans to identify systems at risk. The response tool can take action by disabling networking on an infected system and isolating it from the network.</li>
<li><strong>DDoS attack</strong>: By using only log monitoring, a SIEM tool can be used to detect Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, one of the most dangerous and common types of network attack. Based on log analysis, an alert can be generated for a DoS attack, which can be further automated to redirect traffic to DDoS scrubbers. </li>
</ul>

<p>The basic premise of log management is very simple. Network devices and operating systems all generate events and notifications. The SIEM solution organizes and archives these log event data based on the time period. Any logs older than the duration defined by the security administrator are usually moved to some sort of backup.</p>

<p>Security is defined in multiple ways, but for IT security professionals it's a simple competition against cyber criminals. In this game, the winner owns the network. We cannot protect what we do not understand—it is as simple as that. In this chapter, we discussed how to detect potential security threats before they compromise our network, host infrastructure, and applications. We have also discussed the fact that it is very tough for a human to read all of the logs coming from various devices. Keeping that in mind, we have discussed SIEM tools and its future with automation and automated threat response techniques.</p>
<p class="mce-root">In the next chapter, we will discuss vulnerability assessments and why these are required in every organization for protecting  information.</p>
