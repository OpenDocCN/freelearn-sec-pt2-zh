    includes having end-to-end visibility into usual and unusual traffic patterns,
    URL scanning, blocked traffic, ranking-based websites during visits to malicious
    websites, detecting botnets, DDoS protection, and defense against unknown threats.

    suites will be able to protect their system from all types of cyber threats. Most
    traditional security detection models are old and outdated and even they cannot
    differentiate between malware and regular network traffic. An organization's data
    security programs can ideally stop a majority of known threats. However, there

    designed to monitor or scan network traffic to find suspicious activity and trigger
    alerts when something is trying to compromise an information system through malicious
    activities or security policy violations. Alerting information contains information
    about the source address of the intrusion, the target/victim address, and the
    type of attack that is suspected. An IDS is referred to as attack detection technology,
    but it cannot prevent or stop attacks. In contrast, an IPS device can be used
    to  prevent attacks by detecting them and stopping them proactively before they
    reach a target.

    web servers, mail servers, database servers, or any server that you want to monitor

    fragmentation, or out-of-sequence delivery bypass a network-based IDS but can
    be easily caught by a host-based IDS. The primary goal of any HIDS is to monitor

    just a few racks of servers and a few networking gears. However, this approach
    is almost impossible for a large scale Geo-spread network.

    as soon as malware is detected and will send you an SMS to your cell phone. Your
    SIEM solution will respond to such threats by isolating the infected machine from
    the network, and then peace will be restored when you recieve an SMS to notify
    you that the problem has been temporarily fixed in this way. When you return to
    the office on Monday, you can then analyze security reports and  recover your
    critical systems.

    which can be further automated to redirect traffic to DDoS scrubbers.'

    systems all generate events and notifications. The SIEM solution organizes and
    archives these log event data based on the time period. Any logs older than the
    duration defined by the security administrator are usually moved to some sort
    of backup.

- en: Security is defined in multiple ways, but for IT security professionals it's
    a simple competition against cyber criminals. In this game, the winner owns the
    network. We cannot protect what we do not understand—it is as simple as that.
    In this chapter, we discussed how to detect potential security threats before
    they compromise our network, host infrastructure, and applications. We have also
    discussed the fact that it is very tough for a human to read all of the logs coming
    from various devices. Keeping that in mind, we have discussed SIEM tools and its
    future with automation and automated threat response techniques.
