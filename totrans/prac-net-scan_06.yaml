    organizations and security professionals. In this chapter, we will explore the
    basics of threat detection and ways to mitigate ongoing threats. Finally, you
    will learn to choose and deploy an advanced threat protection system for your
    business goals. The typical network contains information about users and also
    includes security information. A critical step towards protecting your organization
    includes having end-to-end visibility into usual and unusual traffic patterns,
    URL scanning, blocked traffic, ranking-based websites during visits to malicious
    websites, detecting botnets, DDoS protection, and defense against unknown threats.

    Administrators need to stop thinking that the firewall, IPS, IDS, and antivirus
    suites will be able to protect their system from all types of cyber threats. Most
    traditional security detection models are old and outdated and even they cannot
    differentiate between malware and regular network traffic. An organization's data
    security programs can ideally stop a majority of known threats. However, there
    are many *unknown, evil* threats that an organization aims to detect and has not
    encountered before. This can be a result of brand new methods and technologies.

    designed to monitor or scan network traffic to find suspicious activity and trigger
    alerts when something is trying to compromise an information system through malicious
    activities or security policy violations. Alerting information contains information
    about the source address of the intrusion, the target/victim address, and the
    type of attack that is suspected. An IDS is referred to as attack detection technology,
    but it cannot prevent or stop attacks. In contrast, an IPS device can be used
    to  prevent attacks by detecting them and stopping them proactively before they
    reach a target.

    vendors to specify a vendor ID, to put any proprietary information into a flow,
    and to export it out of the collector/analyser for further dissecting and monitoring.

    IPFIX listens on UDP port `4739`, while NetFlow v9 listens on 2055, 2056, 4432,

    your network and who's attacking. Every organization wants the logs coming from
    the all-critical resources of your network and business. As security administrator,
    you always want the logs from your firewall, IPS, and IDS. You will also want
    logs from your key servers sitting in DMZ, and of course you would also include
    Active Directory server and your key application, endpoint, and database servers.

- en: Log collection or aggregation is the heart and soul of a SIEM solution. A SIEM
    should not be confused with SYSLOG data, which is a simple log generated by devices.
    Someone has to look at this log to find out the root cause of the alert. The idea
    is not only to collect log data, but to create a meaningful context from log data.
    SIEM platforms collect event logs from thousands of different sensors installed
    on various devices, and these events provide activity data, which is required
    to analyze the security of our IT environment. In order to get a 360-degree view,
    we need to consolidate what we collect onto a single platform to find out the
    pattern. Aggregation is the process of transformation for data transferring from
    different types of sources into a common repository and meaningful standard format.

    for security administrators to visualize a report on trends and activities, as
    well as to spot anomalies, to track security indicators, and to assess the overall
    security posture of an IT environment. Most SIEM products come with pre-built
    dashboards, but these can also be customized according to requirements.

    to develop improved identification and response times to potential attacks and

    in your IT environment. The first thing you do is try to remotely access your
    network, but for some reason this does not work. Do you have an alternative option?
    You could get changed, travel to the office and start checking IPS/IDS reports
    as well as analyzing security reports, but this might take a lot of time. Investing
    time in reports can cause more damage because such attacks spread quickly. Here,
    the easiest method is to isolate networks by shutting down devices or by unplugging
    the cables. But is that possible? Yes, but only if you have a small network with
    just a few racks of servers and a few networking gears. However, this approach
    is almost impossible for a large scale Geo-spread network.

    as soon as malware is detected and will send you an SMS to your cell phone. Your
    SIEM solution will respond to such threats by isolating the infected machine from
    the network, and then peace will be restored when you recieve an SMS to notify
    you that the problem has been temporarily fixed in this way. When you return to
    the office on Monday, you can then analyze security reports and  recover your
    critical systems.

    of backup.

    a simple competition against cyber criminals. In this game, the winner owns the
    network. We cannot protect what we do not understand—it is as simple as that.
    In this chapter, we discussed how to detect potential security threats before
    they compromise our network, host infrastructure, and applications. We have also
    discussed the fact that it is very tough for a human to read all of the logs coming
    from various devices. Keeping that in mind, we have discussed SIEM tools and its
    future with automation and automated threat response techniques.
