<p>In the previous chapter, we learned about various aspects of security IT infrastructure, including monitoring and responding to incidents, threat detection, and diverting attackers.</p>
<p>In today's digital world, information is accessed, stored, and transferred electronically. The security of this information and the systems storing it are critical to companies' reputations, as well as for providing a better user experience. Consequently, the need to analyze and remediate vulnerabilities from IT infrastructure have become the most important tasks for any security expert, system admin, or network administrator. Even if an organization has a well-managed security infrastructure in place such as a firewall, antivirus, and intrusion detection system, an attacker can still gain unauthorized access by exploiting the vulnerabilities. In the context of software security, vulnerabilities are specific flaws or oversights in a piece of software that can be exploited by attackers. Using assessment methodology, we will focus on security functions and security evaluations in this chapter.</p>
<p><span>We are going to cover the following topics in this chapter:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Infrastructure concerns</li>
<li>Nessus installation and vulnerability assessment methodology</li>
<li>Sample report</li>

<p>With the increasing threat of cyber attacks (including those originating in one's own network) it is now becoming more important for organizations to secure their IT resources. The world is moving faster than ever before—every year cyber criminals launch more attacks than there are patches released by software developers. No single system is managed by one vendor—instead, it is a multi-vendor environment: motherboard manufacturers are different; operating systems are provided by someone else; and storage comes from different vendors. On top of this never-ending list, you have multiple applications installed on operating systems, and then to protect your IT resources you have firewall and cryptography systems. None of these systems are foolproof and they are always vulnerable to attacks.</p>
<p>Changing the whole ecosystem would be a huge, tedious task. Every day new technology arrives, daily patches and releases are released and vendors offer free upgrades. Consequently, it becomes very tough for an IT organization to keep all resources up-to-date.</p>
<p>Apart from the previously mentioned factors, a few common assumptions are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>We're highly protected and guarded by firewalls and an <strong>intrusion detection system</strong> (<strong>IDS</strong>)</li>
<li>Many organizations do not audit until disaster strikes and they are forced to react</li>
<li>My organization isn't a target for attack due to the nature of our business</li>
<li>Vulnerability assessments are too expensive and I do not see any ROI</li>
<li>Attackers are smarter that us; we cannot beat them</li>
<li>My infrastructure is running fine, we never saw a need to audit</li>
<li>We do not know our own network infrastructure</li>
</ul>

<p>In an IT space, vulnerability assessment is the process of identifying and classifying security holes in an organization's system, network, and communication infrastructure, which can be affected by an internal or external threat. Vulnerability assessments typically involve the use of highly automated testing tools such as cloud-hosted instances and network security scanner appliances for internal scans. The results of this are typically provided along with weakness and appropriate solutions. When it comes to identifying such security loopholes, we now need to decide whether we opt for an FAQ, vulnerability assessment, penetration test or compliance test. In fact, vulnerability assessment and penetration tests are both different exercises. From a regulatory compliance point of view, the selection of a vulnerability assessment or a penetration test will depend on the specific control objective you are trying to meet. In a constantly evolving digital era, organizations' methods of data management and security have to be compliant with the standards dictated by regulated bodies or institutions such as PCI, HIPPA, GDPR, ISO or SOX. This is an important factor in ensuring the minimum security requirements are met for running a business. </p>
<p>The following diagram summarizes the vulnerability assessment:</p>

<p>The overall objective of a vulnerability assessment is to scan, investigate, analyze, and report on the severity of risks associated with any vulnerabilities discovered on the external facing resource. It should also provide your organization with an appropriate mitigation plan to address the weaknesses or vulnerabilities previously discovered. Network vulnerability scanning can help an organization to identify weaknesses in their network security. Whether results are good or bad will depend on who runs the scanning first - a system admin or attackers.</p>

<p>Vulnerability assessment can be divided broadly into two major groups:</p>
<ul>
<li class="mce-root">Network-based assessment</li>
<li class="mce-root">Host-based assessment</li>
</ul>
<p>For maximum effectiveness and security, both of the vulnerability assessments mentioned above are required. This is because vulnerabilities can be exploited by an insider, a legitimate user, bad guys outside of the perimeter or an unauthorized user.</p>

<p>The network-based vulnerability assessments are completed by scanner tools which are internally or externally installed. These allow a network administrator to discover and eliminate their organization's network-based security vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>A network vulnerability assessment generally includes tasks such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Password analysis for n<span>etwork devices such as Router/Switches/Wi-Fi </span></li>
<li>Reviewing network strength against <strong>distributed denial of service</strong> (<strong>DDoS</strong>)</li>
<li>Network intrusion</li>
<li>Device-level security analysis (router, switch, computer)</li>
<li>Scanning for known and potential threats and vulnerabilities</li>
</ul>
<p>Some common tools are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nessus</li>
<li>OpenVAS</li>
<li>Qualys</li>
</ul>
<div class="packt_tip packt_infobox">Nessus is a free, open source tool. It is as powerful as some of the best commercial vulnerability assessment scanners.</div>
<p>Most famous network scanners come in the form of both virtual and physical appliances. These are hardware boxes designed to be placed on customer premises such as data centers or office locations. These scanners provide continuous security and compliance monitoring of IT assets and send that data to the Cloud Instance backend scanning engine. Scanning engines are updated in the background with the latest vulnerability signatures. Customers don't have to touch these boxes once they've been deployed. The diagram below demonstrates a typical network-based scanner architecture:</p>

<p>The host-based vulnerability assessment works on a client-server model where the client performs the scan and sends the report back to the server/manager. A host-based scanner is installed on every host on the system that you want to monitor. Host-based vulnerability assessment tools can provide an insight into the potential damage that can be done by insiders and outsiders once some level of access is granted or taken on a system. They are generally useful for discovering weaknesses behind an initial access control setting. Network-based scanners cannot perform a deep low-level security check because they do not have direct access to the file system on the target host. A few famous open source tools include OSSEC, Prelude and SNORT. </p>

<p>Nessus is a pretty strong remote security scanning tool which scans devices and raises an alert if it discovers any vulnerabilities that hackers could use to gain access to a computer you have connected to a network.  Within days of the vulnerabilities being released to the public, there will be plugins for new vulnerabilities. Nessus utilizes Nmap for port scanning.</p>
<p>Let's take a step-by-step look at how to scan a specified network and hosts. </p>

<p>After login, you will see the home page. Follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on <span class="packt_screen">Polices</span>:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/faf1303a-3c07-424c-9e9c-a9c5f0a1339a.png" width="1919" height="474"/></div>
<ol start="2">
<li>Click on new policy. Here, you will see many policies which are default and inbuilt. You have the option to use these default policies or to create your own customized policy to scan by choosing a policy:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/f7007ad2-1714-4262-af3e-fd22dbc9404e.png" width="1753" height="613"/></div>
<ol start="3">
<li>Let's do a basic network scan. Click on the <span class="packt_screen">New Scan</span> and select the <span class="packt_screen">Basic Network Scan</span> policy.</li>
<li>Assign a unique name that reflects the objective or purpose of this scan.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li>In targets, put the target IP address scope. You can also put the range here. For example, <kbd>10.0.0.1-255</kbd> or the entire subnet, <kbd>10.0.0.0/24</kbd>:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-896 image-border" src="Images/b8933086-2c51-4a80-bffa-2496a87e8d2b.png" style="width:90.08em;height:57.58em;" width="1081" height="691"/></div>
<p>The second most important factor is the credentials. You should provide the necessary credentials before scanning the network, depending upon which type of host you have inside the network. You can add credentials for the Windows, SSH, Databases (MySQL, Oracle, and so on), virtual machines, and the ports (FTP, POP3, and so on):</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-897 image-border" src="Images/810d3e69-8fd6-4f99-be8d-e09f9f9ef5e2.png" style="width:155.17em;height:73.67em;" width="1862" height="884"/></div>
<p>I have passed credentials for SSH and Windows. In the same way, you can add more credentials from the list a<span>s shown in the following diagram:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-898 image-border" src="Images/38d68197-c0b3-457a-bb20-7e98bd9f1d14.png" style="width:113.00em;height:78.42em;" width="1356" height="941"/></div>
<p>By default, a network scan runs on common ports and protocol, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/3e85f8f7-c931-44af-8def-d15d922c0f5a.png" style="width:56.42em;height:44.75em;" width="902" height="715"/></div>
<p>You can customize discovery by changing the scan type to custom, which gives you the option to customize host discovery, port scanning, and service discovery:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/6f9b0549-eb02-4523-9d0c-393a92457380.png" style="width:56.58em;height:29.08em;" width="1035" height="532"/></div>
<p>The discovery module has been divided into three parts: </p>
<ul>
<li>Host discovery</li>
<li>Port scanning</li>
<li>Service discovery</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's discuss these modules in detail:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Host Discovery</span>: <span>Host discovery is a method which is used to check the number of live hosts in a given network or network range. The fast network discovery option can be used when you want Nessus to finish scanning as soon as possible. Personally, I would not choose this option as Nessus will not probe the network deeply using it. Nessus can also use TCP Ping, and the specific port numbers can also be defined. For security purposes, most system admins block ICMP. The last method is ICMP-based, which works well if there is no firewall blocking ICMP. You can also upload the list of MAC addresses to scan. UDP might not be a good choice because it is a connection-less protocol and is sometimes undetectable. </span></li>
</ul>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/1a460687-f1ff-4b52-a73a-c049f779b7e7.png" style="width:58.08em;height:30.92em;" width="1202" height="639"/></div>
<ul>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Port Scanning</span>: <span>By default, Nessus will consider all unscanned ports as closed. You can define a range of ports to be scanned, but by default only <kbd>4790</kbd> common ports will be scanned and listed in Nessus. While <span class="packt_screen">All</span> represents all of the <kbd>65365</kbd> ports to scan, a typical system can have a maximum total of <kbd>65365</kbd> ports. The range of port numbers can also be selected, for example, from 1-99. The local port enumerators is a credential-based scan. The <kbd>netstat</kbd> utility is made specifically for a Unix-based system and uses the <kbd>netstat</kbd> command to find the open ports with the status on any running system. In contrast, WMI (netstat) is for Windows-based systems and also requires the credentials to utilize the <kbd>netstat</kbd> commands which can also be launched using the Windows Command Prompt. TCP uses the three-way handshaking process, starting by sending a SYN packet to a remote host. The scanner sends the SYN packet to the target and, after getting the ACK message from the target machine, predicts the operating system based on signatures. The backend process of Nessus utilizes an NMAP signature to detect the operating system:</span></li>
</ul>

<p style="padding-left: 60px">A <strong>Simple Network Management Protocol</strong> (<strong>SNMP</strong>) test is meant for devices like routers, switches, firewalls and other networking devices. The type of device can be predicted by looking at the SNMP walk reply. Make sure you provide a SNMP community string before you launch a scan:</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Service Discovery</span>: <span>This is a Nessus setting designed to find the services associated with port numbers. It probes all ports to find the services running on all of them. <span class="packt_screen">Enabling CRL checking (which connects to the Internet)</span> will check the certificates' revocation:</span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><span class="packt_screen">ASSESSMENT</span>: The assessment setting can be divided into different categories<strong>:<br/></strong>
<ul>
<li><span class="packt_screen">General</span><strong><br/></strong></li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Brute Force</span><strong><br/></strong></li>

<ul>
<li><span class="packt_screen">General</span>: The<strong><span> </span></strong><span class="packt_screen">General</span> tab represents accuracy in a result based on response.

<p>Let's take a look at a sample report based on my Azure-hosted website app. This report was generated by a scan with a default web scan policy to scan URLs <a href="http://myapptestsec.azurewebsites.net">myapptestsec.azurewebsites.net</a>:</p>

<p>Nessus categorized the levels of vulnerabilities into five different parts (from low to high):</p>
<ul>
<li>Info</li>
<li>Low</li>
<li>Medium</li>
<li>High</li>
<li>Critical:</li>

<p>Vulnerabilities are increasing by the day, and networks are becoming increasingly difficult to secure. Vulnerability assessments have become the preferred, mandatory method for managing security flaws for many organizations who care about their reputation. Network vulnerability assessments provide quick identification and a 360-degree view of security weaknesses on a given network, supplemented by host assessment. There are many automated tools that are available to detect and report all critical vulnerabilities. The approach, the way these systems are designed and the techniques they use for vulnerability tests may vary widely. As vulnerability scanning usually targets specific hosts or a range of hosts, it often conducts a deeper inspection than network scanners, identifying software versions, operating systems, specific software applications and services, and system configuration attributes.</p>
<p>In this chapter, <span>we have explored how to install the Nessus VA tool</span> and different settings that you should know about before you launch, scan and generate reports.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will discuss remote OS-detection techniques using NMAP. </p>
