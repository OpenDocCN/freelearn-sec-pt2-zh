    The security of this information and the systems storing it are critical to companies'
    reputations, as well as for providing a better user experience. Consequently,
    the need to analyze and remediate vulnerabilities from IT infrastructure have
    become the most important tasks for any security expert, system admin, or network
    administrator. Even if an organization has a well-managed security infrastructure
    in place such as a firewall, antivirus, and intrusion detection system, an attacker
    can still gain unauthorized access by exploiting the vulnerabilities. In the context
    of software security, vulnerabilities are specific flaws or oversights in a piece
    of software that can be exploited by attackers. Using assessment methodology,
    we will focus on security functions and security evaluations in this chapter.

    one''s own network) it is now becoming more important for organizations to secure
    their IT resources. The world is moving faster than ever before—every year cyber
    criminals launch more attacks than there are patches released by software developers.
    No single system is managed by one vendor—instead, it is a multi-vendor environment:
    motherboard manufacturers are different; operating systems are provided by someone
    else; and storage comes from different vendors. On top of this never-ending list,
    you have multiple applications installed on operating systems, and then to protect
    your IT resources you have firewall and cryptography systems. None of these systems
    are foolproof and they are always vulnerable to attacks.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In an IT space, vulnerability assessment is the process of identifying and classifying
    security holes in an organization's system, network, and communication infrastructure,
    which can be affected by an internal or external threat. Vulnerability assessments
    typically involve the use of highly automated testing tools such as cloud-hosted
    instances and network security scanner appliances for internal scans. The results
    of this are typically provided along with weakness and appropriate solutions.
    When it comes to identifying such security loopholes, we now need to decide whether
    we opt for an FAQ, vulnerability assessment, penetration test or compliance test.
    In fact, vulnerability assessment and penetration tests are both different exercises.
    From a regulatory compliance point of view, the selection of a vulnerability assessment
    or a penetration test will depend on the specific control objective you are trying
    to meet. In a constantly evolving digital era, organizations' methods of data
    management and security have to be compliant with the standards dictated by regulated
    bodies or institutions such as PCI, HIPPA, GDPR, ISO or SOX. This is an important
    factor in ensuring the minimum security requirements are met for running a business.

    discovered on the external facing resource. It should also provide your organization
    with an appropriate mitigation plan to address the weaknesses or vulnerabilities
    previously discovered. Network vulnerability scanning can help an organization
    to identify weaknesses in their network security. Whether results are good or
    bad will depend on who runs the scanning first - a system admin or attackers.

    the potential damage that can be done by insiders and outsiders once some level
    of access is granted or taken on a system. They are generally useful for discovering
    weaknesses behind an initial access control setting. Network-based scanners cannot
    perform a deep low-level security check because they do not have direct access
    to the file system on the target host. A few famous open source tools include

    deeply using it. Nessus can also use TCP Ping, and the specific port numbers can
    also be defined. For security purposes, most system admins block ICMP. The last
    method is ICMP-based, which works well if there is no firewall blocking ICMP.

    difficult to secure. Vulnerability assessments have become the preferred, mandatory
    method for managing security flaws for many organizations who care about their
    reputation. Network vulnerability assessments provide quick identification and
    a 360-degree view of security weaknesses on a given network, supplemented by host
    assessment. There are many automated tools that are available to detect and report
    all critical vulnerabilities. The approach, the way these systems are designed
    and the techniques they use for vulnerability tests may vary widely. As vulnerability
    scanning usually targets specific hosts or a range of hosts, it often conducts
    a deeper inspection than network scanners, identifying software versions, operating
    systems, specific software applications and services, and system configuration
    attributes.
