    online banking, food ordering and in many places besides. Every year, we continue
    to encounter issues such as cyber threats, illegal surveillance (Wikileaks), and
    anti-privacy advocacy that targets these areas. In a connected world like the
    internet, security and privacy is a must when it comes to protecting data. As
    an end user, it's impossible to have an end-to-end visibility on public internet
    infrastructure that we use day to day. Fortunately, we have **virtual private
    networks** (**VPN**), a type of shield which forms a secure tunnel between two
    or more VPN supported devices. VPN helps to protect data traffic from snooping
    or man-in-the-middle attacks. However, to pick the best VPN service out there,
    we first need to understand the different VPN types and their use cases.

    installation is not required since almost all operating systems offer inbuilt
    VPN clients. 256 bit encryption is a mandatory addition to the L2TP VPN. L2TP
    is a CPU processor that is intensive due to double encapsulation. The first encapsulation

    secrets for authentication, which is identical on both ends of the connection
    termination point. This would be done rather than setting up a **Certificate Authority**
    (**CA**) and issuing individual keys to each IPSec endpoint. Consequently, if
    one endpoint is compromised or physically stolen, the whole network becomes vulnerable.
    As IT staff keeps changing, the secrecy of that pre-shared key defeats the object
    over time. An SSL/TLS certificate based VPN works well, but that also brings device
    configuration overheads. However, if you still decide on using pre-shared keys
    then you should have a process in place for changing them after a certain amount
    of time, and you should use different pre-shared keys on different VPN connections.
    For approved and strong encryption, you must look at the **Federal Information

    connectivity for financial institutions, encrypted managed services for carriers,
    and secured networks for government institutions. Since it is done at the lowest
    layer possible in the OSI model, Layer 1 encryption technically provides the highest
    level of security. It also has fast speed and low latency, as well as 100% throughput
    with 0 bytes overhead:'

- en: This chapter provides a very detailed overview of VPNs, with a focus on using
    IPSec as a VPN technology. It started by covering the various use cases for VPN
    and available options. It then covered the technicalities of different VPN protocols,
    such as PPTP, L2TP, SSTP, IPsec, and the components that make up IPSec.

    remote access VPNs by looking at full and split tunnel options and their benefits.
    The chapter finished by looking at WAN encryption techniques, from Enterprise
    to cloud services and financial organizations, in order to ensure security on
    different layers of the data communication model.
