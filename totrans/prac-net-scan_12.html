<p>In the previous chapter, we discussed the security aspect of WAN infrastructure as well as <span>the ability of technologies such as IPSec and VPN design to build a secure network over a public internet infrastructure</span>. </p>
<p>Almost 3 to 4 billion devices are currently connected to the internet and this number will be doubled with IOT devices. In this case, hackers won't be limited to one space. Instead, the area can be accommodated in almost every field from hospitals to traffic lights, as these will also <span>be</span><span> controlled and operated over some sort of WAN connectivity. The main question here is: What are the long-term implications for network security? One thing is for sure, it will be different from today. We will also talk about how Artificial Intelligence will help in cyber security space.</span></p>
<p><span>We are going to cover the following topics in this chapter:</span></p>

<p><strong>DDoS</strong>, short for <strong>distributed denial of service</strong>, is a form of attack in which multiple compromised networks/hosts are used to target a single system.

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Do you recall days when network admins used to call internet service providers to mitigate DDoS attacks? <strong>Remotely-Triggered Black Hole</strong> (<strong>RTBH</strong>) routing is an interesting application of <strong>Border Gateway Protocol</strong> (<strong>BGP</strong>) as a security tool within service provider networks. One common use for RTBH is mitigation of DDoS attacks. RTBH provides two methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Source-based</li>
<li>Destination-based</li>
</ul>
<p>The basic approach is to either drop all traffic from the source or to drop all traffic to the destination. This could be both wanted and unwanted traffic. At this point, we do understand that RTBH routing is a technique that can be used to protect from DDoS attacks. Let's discuss how it works to protect your network.</p>
<p>The following diagram shows an ISP with several provider edge routers and a customer network connected to the edge router for public internet access.  </p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/4f13cf09-1b41-492a-8e57-55094a84c70c.png" style="width:58.42em;height:31.58em;" width="1038" height="561"/></div>
<div class="packt_infobox">Keep in mind that RTBH routing works with BGP.</div>
<p>Let's assume that a DDoS attack is launched against a customer's application, such as a web server. In case an ISP does not have any protection to stop and this continues, this attack will cause a customer's application to become out of service as well as impacting other customers with degraded services. When I refer to a degraded service, this will depend on what kind of DDoS attack was launched that might congest the ISP links. The ISP router may not be able to process a number of packets during an attack.</p>
<p>In this diagram, you can see a customer network connected to Tier-1 ISP and Tier-1 ISP further connected to Tier-2 ISP. Once the attacker launches an attack, it can originate from anywhere on the internet in the direction of the customer network. The PC symbol marked in red represents the attacker's machines or comprised machines on the internet that belong to the <strong>Botnet Army</strong>.</p>

<p>What can the ISP do during an attack?</p>
<ul>
<li>Black hole traffic from the source of the attack</li>
<li>Black hole traffic to the destination of the attack</li>
</ul>
<p>The big question is: which method of ISP should you opt for? Let's discuss both options in detail.</p>

<p>A source-based method is the preferred method by ISP. This would drop all traffic coming from the attackers to the customer's web server while allowing other legitimate traffic to go through. This can be a pretty nice solution if the source IP address is fixed, but the problem comes when today's sophisticated attack comes with constantly changing origins. </p>

<p>Using a destination-based approach will drop all traffic (including legitimate traffic) to the customer's web server. This simply translates to helping attackers to achieve their goals to make customer services unavailable. The only good part of this method is that it won't impact other ISP customers or cause any kind of service degradation.</p>

<p>BGP FlowSpec is a new method defined in RFC 5575 that can be used to prevent DDoS attacks in an automated fashion by leveraging BGP. The BGP <strong>flow specification</strong> (<strong>FlowSpec</strong>) feature allows you to automatically propagate the filtering and policing functionality to service a provider's upstream BGP peer routers. This will mitigate the effects of a DDoS attack on your network. Most vendors still have this implementation in their roadmaps. For support, please check with ISP before implementing this solution.</p>
<p>BGP FlowSpec uses a more granular approach and provides you with the flexibility to effectively construct instructions to match a particular data flow with source, destination, L4 parameters, and packet specifics, such as length, and fragment. In this example, the customer router (which is the FlowSpec router) advertises these flows to the ISP edge routers. These edge routers then install the flows in the hardware. Once the flow is installed in the hardware, the transit routers are able to do a lookup to see if incoming traffic matches the defined flows and take appropriate action.</p>
<p>In the following diagram, a customer advertises the <kbd>1.1.1.1/32</kbd> host network with special community <kbd>100:100</kbd> to the service provider. Once this community is matched at the service provider end, all the traffic destined for the customer network will be dropped by all edge routers within service provider 1. </p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Organizations have only two options for handling DDoS attacks: <strong>black-holing</strong> or <strong>scrubbing.</strong> As we have already discussed, black-holing does not scale well and could shut down the designated target to protect everyone else. The other solution is scrubbing, which uses separate DDoS cleaning engines. The tricky part is the BGP announcement, which diverts all network layer packets from the targeted IP address to your mitigation provider's scrubbing servers. The malicious packets are filtered out and clean traffic or non-DDoS is forwarded to actual services.</p>
<p>Cloud service providers, or internet service providers, often provision these scrubbers to a local data center. Industry has seen that DDoS attacks have scaled to &gt; 1 Tbps traffic and having that much network capacity is a major task. Deploying that amount of bandwidth for DDoS mitigation is expensive and complicated to manage. Scrubbers are dumb pieces of equipment that have to be configured by experts. This means that you also have to build competency at all levels for all protocols. Scrubbing centers operate in an offline mode and are only activated when DDoS occurs. This simply means that an internet application will succumb to DDoS before traffic is redirected to a scrubbing center.</p>

<p>An increase in DDoS attacks has led to discovering newer and better ways to protect our systems. The basic idea is to create a system that would allow people to rent out their unused bandwidth, so that it can be used to absorb malicious DDoS traffic and mitigate attacks. ISP charges the customer a minimum amount and the customer loses this money by not utilizing the bandwidth.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>In the future, AI could be a cyber security game-changer. Cyber security vendors are innovating to bring AI-based cyber security products to market in a big way. The deployment of such technology will gain momentum in the coming years. <strong>Machine learning</strong> (<strong>ML</strong>) is a sub-branch of <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> (<strong>AI</strong>) that refers to technologies that enable computers to learn and adapt through experience. ML can be used to identify malicious behavior or malicious entities, hackers, attackers, malware, unwanted behavior, and so on. The biggest challenge would be to define what normal behavior is for an application.</p>
<p>For example, you can see when the maximum number of users are online on an online shopping company, as well as being able to view the number of connections with a data pattern. When it comes to a big sale, the number of users is expected to be high, so you could add another pattern to accommodate this. By using ML, you can record the pattern of users and data traffic on that portal. Anything that is not expected, such as a connection surge in the night, can be treated as an attack. Another example would be if you have a network printer installed on your network. What would the expected behavior be here? It will print the document correctly but what if your network printer starts sending documents outside of the network to someone else?</p>
<p>So the basic point is to deploy a solution that scans everything on your network. This includes the employee logon host, printer, web services, network devices and firewall. You should also learn the behavioral  pattern to identify what is normal and what is abnormal. Tools such as Datatrace and Splunk are good examples of network <span>behavioral analytics.</span></p>
<p>AI can solve the following problems in cyber security space:</p>
<ul>
<li class="mce-root"> Malicious external and internal threats</li>
<li class="mce-root"> DDoS and large-scale attacks</li>
<li class="mce-root"> Data loss</li>
<li class="mce-root"> User behavioral analytics</li>
</ul>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Security operation centers always struggle with alert floods coming from the legacy SIEM systems and false positives continue to haunt the network with data breaches. With the evolution of the computer landscape, cyber security has also changed. Let's talk about the days when employees used office desktops to access corporate applications. Things were <span>rapidly</span><span> </span><span>replaced with laptops and smart devices, which has secure access to corporate applications from anywhere in the world. Traditional methods for detecting and responding to security threats are no longer effective when it comes to addressing today's security challenges. Today, organizations need a SIEM solution that can scale to support large data volumes coming from various IT resources, as well as analyzing data at a faster speed in order to detect security threats in real time. At the same time, it should fit into the organization's budget. </span></p>
<p>In this section, we will discuss the key capabilities that a next generation SIEM platform should have. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Big-Data Storage Capabilities</strong>:<strong> </strong>Network-connected devices' methods for data amount growth is expanding. It's not all about simply collecting huge amounts of data; it also has to be maintained for threat analysis and forensic and regulatory compliance. You must have the capability to store data in a different way, and that different way comes in the form of a big data model. Big data can consume and analyze terabytes of data in real time. Query-based data can be further used for analysis and reporting.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The following diagram shows a <strong>SIEM MODEL</strong> that has the capabilities discussed previously in this section: </p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-840 image-border" src="Images/e04d0be5-01a8-469d-8e6a-c38ecb8da1fa.png" style="width:30.33em;height:30.33em;" width="1010" height="1009"/></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Real-Time Analytics</strong>: Cyber threats and cyber attacks have become highly sophisticated. With an increasing number of  surface attacks, attackers are now targeting organizations with ease. Legacy SIEM solutions are rule-based and dependent to know threat patterns. A next generation SIEM should be sufficiently capable of detecting threats in real time for any dynamic environment. This is done by using ML and behavior analytics in order to find highly advanced threats in today's environment.</li>
</ul>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-837 image-border" src="Images/8c58aac1-9cd4-494a-b008-11a8065d1411.png" style="width:32.08em;height:12.58em;" width="1525" height="597"/></div>
<ul>
<li class="mce-root"><strong>Accuracy</strong>: Threat intelligence can help you to stay one step ahead of cyber threats by providing you with a rich, external context. Without the proper context, a security alert may likely get lost during an alert flood or may be confused with a <strong>security operations center</strong> (<strong>SOC</strong>) analyst. As SOC professionals, how might we react to such alerts? Next generation SIEM should send alerts with a meaningful context. A meaningful context can include an IP address, location, vulnerability type, action required, and, of course, alert priority or severity.</li>
<li class="mce-root"><strong>Automated Incident Response</strong>: <span>Detecting cyber security threats is just one part of SIEM, but responding to threats faster is considered the most critical part of SIEM. Every alert generated by SIEM always has a recommended action associated with it. Next generation SIEM should follow best practice by having APIs interact with network and system vendor devices such as firewalls, routers, switches, and endpoint protection devices.The basic idea of this is to take an appropriate, well-defined and automated set of actions once an incident is detected.</span></li>
<li class="mce-root"><strong>Easy Deployment</strong>:<strong> </strong><span>For any business and IT process, the deployment of SIEM systems begins with thoroughly planning and reviewing impact and policies. You should also review your security policies and the best practices available in the industry. The deployment model should correspond to the overall IT strategy of organization. The SIEM solution should offer virtual, cloud-based and hardware- based appliances to the customer.</span></li>
<li class="mce-root"><strong>Low Cost</strong>:<strong> </strong><span><span>Security analytics work well with large amounts of data. With a growing number of devices, a large volume of logging data and storage might escalate the cost of the solution. A pricing model should not be based on the volume of data that is collected because this may cause unpredictability in the costing model. Next Generation SIEM costing can be based on the number of users and devices, which is a predictable number. The use of commodity hardware may reduce this cost further.</span></span></li>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Software Defined Networking Firewall</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Over the past few years, continuous innovation and the need to adapt to the constraints of conventional networking has made <strong>software defined networking</strong> (<strong>SDN</strong>) pretty popular. Let's discuss what is so special about SDN that legacy technology is not able to deliver.</p>
<p>The current design of network infrastructure does not support dynamic scalability, central control and management, end-to-end visibility and dynamic traffic load distribution. It is an approach that physically separates the network's control plane from the data plane. This allows network administrators to program directly without having to worry about the commodity hardware specifications.</p>
<p>The following diagram shows SDN architecture. The SDN architecture can be divided into three layers: <strong>Application Layer</strong>, <strong>Control Plane</strong>, and <strong>Forwarding Plane</strong>.</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-838 image-border" src="Images/2aa48b2c-771d-43c9-8e85-fa5903e262d3.png" style="width:39.83em;height:25.83em;" width="1069" height="693"/></div>
<p>In this section, we will discuss how we <span>can</span><span> use SDN functionality for firewalls. A firewall is a device that filters incoming and outgoing traffic in the network that has passed through network devices based on firewall rules. A traditional firewall is placed between a public and private network. The rule configuration is defined by the network administrator and, with every new rule, firewalls have to be configured. Hardware firewalls are expensive and vendor locked-in, which means that only vendors can modify the behavior of the firewall. As discussed, software defined networking is a new approach to networking. SDN offers the flexibility to convert commodity-based OpenFlow supported hardware into firewalls, which is software managed.</span></p>
<p>Control Plane is used for management tasks and has a global view of network topology. All decisions regarding <span>forwarding the packets are made by the Control Plane. The controller uses an OpenFlow protocol to communicate with commodity switches and it also has the capability to change the flow of entries directly into a TCAM table of switches. Similar to the firewall rule, the flow entry is used for matching purposes and has actions associated with the flow.</span></p>
<p>A typical flow table looks like the following diagram. Header fields are fields that should be matched to IP packets and the actions would be defined by the administrator.</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-986 image-border" src="Images/c7a23ee5-ea56-476c-9e8c-9b3f13165907.png" style="width:47.17em;height:22.50em;" width="1202" height="574"/></div>
<p>Overall, this approach creates a distributed firewall architecture and rules are pushed across all the devices or specified groups of device. In this diagram, you can see three layers: <strong>Firewall Application</strong>, <strong>Control Plane</strong>, and <strong>Forwarding Plane</strong>.</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-839 image-border" src="Images/cd75544c-8e3c-4df4-90b3-33db179bd49b.png" style="width:39.67em;height:27.17em;" width="978" height="670"/></div>
<p>The following table demonstrates a firewall flow and rule:</p>

<p><strong>Bring-Your-Own-Identity</strong> (<strong>BYOI</strong>) is an authentication mechanism that offers a better user experience and is more secure than having multiple passwords for multiple services. BYOI simply refers to integrating with social networking sites (for example,  Facebook, Google, and Yahoo). In practice, an example of BYOI is demonstrated by having an option to sign up to a website using Facebook, as demonstrated in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/62388967-f911-4b8a-83af-109ab35b791b.png" style="width:27.08em;height:17.42em;" width="782" height="504"/></div>
<p><span>You are probably familiar with users in a typical organization complaining about having to use different passwords, applications and authentication methods. Wouldn't it be nice to have one unified solution and the same identity for all your Cloud, SaaS, Web Apps, or on-premises applications? Citrix work space experience is a cool solution that provides a better user experience.</span></p>
<p>Many websites attract more users just because they do not have to manage separate passwords, which is a headache for most of us, especially along with tackling security issues. This increases security by enabling users to use two-factor authentication with a single trusted provider. Single identity providers bring some privacy concerns, which makes it possible to track and profile user activity over multiple services.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we discussed how the security landscape is changing, keeping in mind that cyber attacks have evolved from worms and viruses to sophisticated attacks in cyberspace. It is high time that we shift our focus from protection to prevention. It has been proven by recent data breaches that the old legacy system is not enough to protect assets from advanced security threats. In this chapter, we discussed old methods and new, enhanced methods to combat DDoS protection by using BGP Flowspec. </p>
<p>Furthermore, we learned how DDoS scrubbing works and how Blackchain technology is going to change the security landscape. We also discussed the need for Artificial Intelligence in cyber space, and how this would help to build an intelligent next generation SIEM solution. Finally, we discussed the <span>concept</span><span> of</span><span> a firewall built on top of software defined networking, as well as </span><span>Bring-Your-Own-Identity,</span><span> a new approach that introduces better security and a better user experience.  </span></p>
