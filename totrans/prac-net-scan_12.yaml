    this continues, this attack will cause a customer's application to become out
    of service as well as impacting other customers with degraded services. When I

    launched that might congest the ISP links. The ISP router may not be able to process

    DDoS attacks in an automated fashion by leveraging BGP. The BGP **flow specification**
    (**FlowSpec**) feature allows you to automatically propagate the filtering and
    policing functionality to service a provider's upstream BGP peer routers. This
    will mitigate the effects of a DDoS attack on your network. Most vendors still
    have this implementation in their roadmaps. For support, please check with ISP
    before implementing this solution.

- en: BGP FlowSpec uses a more granular approach and provides you with the flexibility
    to effectively construct instructions to match a particular data flow with source,
    destination, L4 parameters, and packet specifics, such as length, and fragment.
    In this example, the customer router (which is the FlowSpec router) advertises
    these flows to the ISP edge routers. These edge routers then install the flows
    in the hardware. Once the flow is installed in the hardware, the transit routers
    are able to do a lookup to see if incoming traffic matches the defined flows and
    take appropriate action.

    network will be dropped by all edge routers within service provider 1.

    solution is scrubbing, which uses separate DDoS cleaning engines. The tricky part

    scrubbers to a local data center. Industry has seen that DDoS attacks have scaled
    to > 1 Tbps traffic and having that much network capacity is a major task. Deploying
    that amount of bandwidth for DDoS mitigation is expensive and complicated to manage.
    Scrubbers are dumb pieces of equipment that have to be configured by experts.
    This means that you also have to build competency at all levels for all protocols.
    Scrubbing centers operate in an offline mode and are only activated when DDoS
    occurs. This simply means that an internet application will succumb to DDoS before

    can record the pattern of users and data traffic on that portal. Anything that
    is not expected, such as a connection surge in the night, can be treated as an
    attack. Another example would be if you have a network printer installed on your

    A firewall is a device that filters incoming and outgoing traffic in the network
    that has passed through network devices based on firewall rules. A traditional
    firewall is placed between a public and private network. The rule configuration
    is defined by the network administrator and, with every new rule, firewalls have
    to be configured. Hardware firewalls are expensive and vendor locked-in, which
    means that only vendors can modify the behavior of the firewall. As discussed,
    software defined networking is a new approach to networking. SDN offers the flexibility
    to convert commodity-based OpenFlow supported hardware into firewalls, which is
    software managed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Control Plane is used for management tasks and has a global view of network
    topology. All decisions regarding forwarding the packets are made by the Control
    Plane. The controller uses an OpenFlow protocol to communicate with commodity
    switches and it also has the capability to change the flow of entries directly
    into a TCAM table of switches. Similar to the firewall rule, the flow entry is
    used for matching purposes and has actions associated with the flow.
