<p class="mce-root">This book will teach you how to execute penetration testing from start to finish. Starting from the pre-engagement phase, you will learn threat modeling for the architecture phase. After that, you will engage in the source code review process. Following this, you will also learn how to execute web application and network infrastructure penetration testing, and finally, you'll discover how to automate all this using Python.</p>

<p>This book is for security professionals and enthusiasts who want to deepen their knowledge of the web penetration testing world. Many topics will be covered in this book, but you will need the basics of ethical hacking before you start reading (many online courses out there will get you up to speed). If you're a professional, I'm betting that you will appreciate a lot the straight forward checklists that I will provide. In fact, I use them myself in my career as a penetration tester.</p>

<p>To get the most out of this book you need to know the basics of ethical hacking and you will need to build a lab. You will need a virtual machine software (for example, VirtualBox or VMware) for the virtualization of the lab environment. To follow the examples, you will also need to install Kali Linux. Don't worry, I will discuss how to do it in <a href="f8ba8588-dd02-4afe-82b9-b014df40ebc9.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Kali Linux Installation</em>. Kali Linux will be the attacker machine that we will use to test the security of the victim's machine. Speaking of the victim host, I encourage you to install a Windows 7 virtual machine where you will install a vulnerable web application called Mutillidae. Again, I will walk you through all the steps of building the vulnerable host in <a href="e4eda6be-5c34-495e-8c1d-4a83848d8000.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Building a Vulnerable Web Application Lab</em>. Finally, I will be using Burp Suite Professional Edition, but you can follow along with the free edition of this tool. That being said, all the tools that we are going to use for the security tests are already installed by default on Kali Linux.</p>

<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "The <kbd>-y</kbd> in the <kbd>upgrade</kbd> command will accept the prompts automatically."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre><span>class </span>ServiceDTO:<br/>    <span># Class Constructor<br/></span><span>    </span><span>def </span><span>__init__</span>(<span>self</span>, port, name, description):<br/>        <span>self</span>.description = description<br/>        <span>self</span>.port = port<br/>        <span>self</span>.name = name</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong><span>meterpreter &gt; getsystem</span></strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "Click on <span class="packt_screen">Continue</span>, and your system will reboot.</span><span>"</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
