<p><span>What exactly is Kali Linux?</span></p>
<p><span>Kali Linux (previously called BackTrack) is a free, open source, Debian-based Linux distribution. This operating system has hundreds of applications installed, which can help us to conduct a successful penetration test.</span></p>
<p><span>And, guess what? Kali Linux is used by bad hackers (also known as black hat hackers), too. This means that we (security professionals) will have more accurate results, because we are using the same tools that the bad guys use to compromise systems.</span></p>
<p>You can install this beast on any virtualization host (VMware, VirtualBox, or HyperV). Also, you can install it on an ARM processor-based computer, like the <span>Raspberry Pi</span>.</p>
<p>Finally, you need to know that <span>Kali Linux is developed, funded, and maintained by Offensive Security, and you can visit their site at</span> <a href="https://www.Kali.org">https://www.Kali.org</a>.</p>

<p>Let's suppose that you have a laptop or a dedicated host, and you want to install Kali Linux. Follow the steps in this section, and you can install this monster on your machine. Also, you can install a fresh copy on a virtual machine (if you want to learn the details of the installation process yourself), but Kali Linux offers pre-built VMs, which we will learn about later in this chapter:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, you need to download Kali. Simply browse to <a href="https://www.kali.org/downloads">https://www.kali.org/downloads</a>, and you will land on the download page for this <span class="packt_screen">operating system</span> (<span class="packt_screen">OS</span>).</li>
<li>I will choose the <span class="packt_screen">2018.1 64</span> bit version, and will click on the <span class="packt_screen">HTTP</span> link to download it directly to my machine. After the download has completed, you will need to copy the ISO file to a bootable USB drive. You're probably asking yourself this question: how do I make my USB bootable? There is a Windows tool that I always use for creating a bootable USB, called <strong>Win32 Disk Imager</strong>. You can download a copy of this tool at <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager">https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager</a>, and it's free!</li>
<li>I'm assuming that you have created your bootable USB copy of Kali, and that you have just booted your physical machine. On the first screen, you will need to choose the <span class="packt_screen">Graphical install</span> option:</li>
</ol>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-620 image-border" src="Images/beb67bf8-79c0-4f1f-b566-3b44d4405e05.png" style="width:25.42em;height:19.08em;" width="672" height="503"/></div>
<ol start="4">
<li>When you press <em>Enter</em>, you will have to choose the <span class="packt_screen">L<span class="packt_screen">a</span></span><span class="packt_screen">nguage</span>;<strong> </strong>I will choose <span class="packt_screen">English</span>, and click on the <span class="packt_screen">Continue</span> button. After that, you will need to choose your <span class="packt_screen">Country</span>, so I will pick <span class="packt_screen">Canada</span>, since it's my homeland, and click on the <span class="packt_screen">Continue</span> button. Next, you have to choose the <strong><span class="packt_screen">keyboard layout</span></strong>. In my case, it's going to be <span class="packt_screen">American English</span>. We can then proceed to the next step.</li>
<li>At this stage, you will be prompted to enter the <span class="packt_screen">Hostname</span> of your Kali machine. It's your choice; name it whatever you'd like.</li>
<li>Next, enter your local <span class="packt_screen">Domain name</span>. If you don't have one, that's fine; just write <kbd>workgroup</kbd>, or anything that is meaningful to you (I have a local domain called <kbd>home.lan</kbd>):</li>
</ol>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-622 image-border" src="Images/a5b1b035-cb96-480d-b143-082f35a1d46d.png" style="width:47.42em;height:35.33em;" width="705" height="525"/></div>
<ol start="7">
<li>In the next step, you will enter the <span class="packt_screen">Password</span> for your Kali root account; confirm it twice, and click on <span class="packt_screen">Continue</span>. After this, you will be asked to configure the clock. I'm living in the <span class="packt_screen">Eastern</span> time zone; yours might be different, depending on where your city is located:</li>
</ol>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/0bce572f-bb60-487d-8f3d-3335ab7f81ac.png" style="width:51.33em;height:38.33em;" width="705" height="526"/></div>
<ol start="8">
<li>Now, it's time to set up the partitions for the installation. I always use either <span class="packt_screen">Guided – use entire disk</span> (for a non-encrypted setup) or <span class="packt_screen">Guided – use entire disk and set up encrypted LVM</span> (for an encrypted installation—this setup will encrypt your disk drive). I will choose the first one, but I highly encourage you to choose the encrypted setup if you're installing this on a physical machine, especially if it's a laptop:</li>
</ol>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/ecead080-499d-4ef4-aebc-f8a2c616fe04.png" style="width:57.58em;height:42.92em;" width="705" height="526"/></div>
<ol start="9">
<li>Next, you will need to choose the partition disk where you'll install Kali. Most of the time, you will see only one big partition; select it to <span class="packt_screen">Continue</span>:</li>
</ol>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/81b51498-fa72-49ad-88ab-6c6e383f647c.png" style="width:49.00em;height:36.58em;" width="705" height="526"/></div>
<ol start="10">
<li>On the next screen, select <span class="packt_screen">All files in one partition</span>; this is what I always choose for Kali. If you're a sophisticated geek and would like to separate the partitions, feel free to do so. </li>
<li>After this step, you will be asked to <span class="packt_screen">Finish partitioning and write changes to disk</span>; what else are you going to choose, right?</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Select <span class="packt_screen">Yes</span> to write the changes to disk.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Finally! The installation will start, and, depending on your machine, it will take a few minutes to finish.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Don't party yet; there are still a few more steps before you can start to use Kali. When the installation has finished, you will be asked to choose a <span class="packt_screen">N</span><span class="packt_screen">etwork Mirror</span>. Select <span class="packt_screen">Yes</span> and continue (you will need the network mirror for updating your Kali Linux).</p>
<ol start="12">
<li>After this step, leave the proxy textbox empty, unless you have a proxy inside of your network:</li>
</ol>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/3463260f-2d3c-4f34-8094-bf06fbf897a9.png" style="width:49.42em;height:36.83em;" width="705" height="525"/></div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">We're not too far from the finish line. On the next screen, you will be asked to choose whether to install the <span class="packt_screen">GRUB boot loader</span>. I will say <span class="packt_screen">Yes</span>, since I like this feature. This option will allow GRUB to be installed on the master boot record (the first screen that you will see when you boot your machine).</p>
<ol start="13">
<li>Next, you will choose the disk partition for the GRUB boot loader. In this case, you will see only one option, so select it to <span class="packt_screen">Continue</span>:</li>
</ol>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/60c9eaad-3cf1-492e-ab03-aed96e863e47.png" style="width:53.58em;height:40.33em;" width="705" height="530"/></div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">At this stage, a final installation will be executed (to finish the setup process), and you will be greeted with a message saying that Kali is ready. Hooray!</p>
<ol start="14">
<li>Click on <span class="packt_screen">Continue</span>, and your system will reboot. When you get to the login screen, enter <kbd>root</kbd> for the username, and then enter the password that you chose during the installation process.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you have <strong>VMware</strong> and you want to install Kali Linux on it, then this section is for you. In the previous section, you saw how to install Kali from scratch, but you don't need to do that if you have VMware. All you need to do is download the image file and import it into VMware, and you're good to go:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>To download the VMware image file, go to</span> <a href="https://www.kali.org/downloads">https://www.kali.org/downloads</a> <span>and scroll down a little bit, until you see the following section:</span></li>
</ol>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/c2baa722-9f46-462a-a37c-69969aa0c637.png" style="width:41.67em;height:6.08em;" width="671" height="98"/></div>
<ol start="2">
<li>Follow the link to the <span class="packt_screen">Offensive Security Download Page</span>. On this page, you will see a table that contains the virtual image copies of VMware:</li>
</ol>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-529 image-border" src="Images/8d59b52f-422a-4133-852b-41dacde91b47.png" style="width:44.25em;height:17.83em;" width="853" height="344"/></div>
<ol start="3">
<li>Choose either the 32- or 64-bit version, and download it locally to your machine. Then, you will need to import it into VMware, so locate the <span class="packt_screen">File</span> menu (click on it) and then click on <span class="packt_screen">Open</span>:</li>
</ol>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/e43a3134-82f9-4a44-8b7d-e470784975c1.png" style="width:29.33em;height:20.00em;" width="433" height="295"/></div>
<ol start="4">
<li>A dialog window will show up, and you should select your downloaded image file. <span>Once Kali is imported into VMware, you will need to alter its default settings. To accomplish that, click on</span> <span class="packt_screen">Edit virtual machine settings</span>:</li>
</ol>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/088ba853-61b7-4ded-aa9b-cef91db0c0b2.png" style="width:36.42em;height:19.50em;" width="601" height="322"/></div>
<ol start="5">
<li>First, you need to check the <span class="packt_screen">Memory</span> settings. Click on the <span class="packt_screen">Memory</span> device, and make sure that you have at least 2,048 MB (2 GB) of memory. If you have a good host machine, it will be much better if you increase it to 4 GB:</li>
</ol>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/ffef4e4d-5020-4dcb-952b-86783dacc8d0.png" style="width:45.75em;height:40.92em;" width="683" height="611"/></div>
<ol start="6">
<li>Next, click on the <span class="packt_screen">Processors</span> device, and make sure that you have enough processing power for your Kali Linux host. Be generous with your new baby machine:</li>
</ol>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/8c12b917-ec68-4fb9-9353-1dd28b20c915.png" style="width:45.00em;height:40.33em;" width="690" height="619"/></div>
<ol start="7">
<li>Now, it's time to set the network settings. If you want to separate your virtual machine from your <strong>local area network</strong> (<strong>LAN</strong>), then you need to choose the <span class="packt_screen">NAT</span> option. If you choose <span class="packt_screen">NAT</span>, then your VM will automatically be assigned a dynamic IP address, using a virtual DHCP server (check the following section, <em>Bridged versus NAT versus Internal Network</em>, for more details):</li>

<ol start="8">
<li>When you use a virtual machine, you need to share files between Kali Linux and your local machine. To accomplish this, you need a shared folder. To add one, click on the <span class="packt_screen">Options</span> tab and select the <span class="packt_screen">Always enabled</span> radio button. Then, click on the <span class="packt_screen">Add...</span> button to point to your local machine folder. This setup is specific to Windows, but it looks very similar on macOS:</li>

<ol start="9">
<li>Now, you can boot your Kali VM, but on the first boot, I recommend that you install the VMware tools. To do so, open your Terminal window and execute the following commands:</li>

<p><strong>VirtualBox</strong> is a very popular virtualization product, because it's free and it offers professional features. You will probably use VirtualBox for your virtualization environment. My base machine is either Windows or macOS, and I have VirtualBox installed on top of it, so I can use Kali Linux for my penetration testing tasks.</p>
<p>Kali offers us pre-built images for VirtualBox, so all we need to do is import them and start using Kali right away. Amazing, right? See the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>To download the VirtualBox image file, go to <a href="https://www.kali.org/downloads">https://www.kali.org/downloads</a> and scroll down a little bit, until you see the following section:</li>

Let's go back to the VM settings and select the <span class="packt_screen">Shared Folders</span> tab. Then, click on the Add button on the right-hand side. A pop-up window will open, in which you can enter the path to the folder locally to your physical machine (Windows or macOS) and give your shared folder a name. I personally use the <span class="packt_screen">Auto-mount</span> option, as well, to make sure that this feature always works when I boot up my Kali host:</li>

<ol start="11">
<li>Now, you can boot your Kali VM. On the first boot, I recommend that you install the VirtualBox Guest Additions. To do so, open your Terminal window and execute the following three commands:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>apt-get update</strong><br/><strong>apt-get install -y virtualbox-guest-x11</strong><br/><strong>reboot</strong></pre>
<p>After the <kbd>reboot</kbd> command, your VM will restart. You will be set to start using the fantastic OS Kali Linux!</p>

            <article>
                
<p>People are totally confused regarding how the network configurations in VirtualBox and VMware work. The three most popular configurations are <strong>Bridged</strong>, <strong>NAT</strong>, and <strong>Internal Network</strong>.</p>
<p>Let's start with the easiest option, which is the Bridged network. This architecture will let your Kali Linux connect directly to your network (LAN), and will get an automatic IP address from your home router. So, if your network is <kbd>192.168.0.0</kbd>, then your Kali IP address will be something like <kbd>192.168.0.x</kbd> (for example, <kbd>192.168.0.101</kbd>). Now, you can interact with the machines on your network by using Kali Linux:</p>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/12e7e5c4-d76a-4d7d-98dd-70cd19ef1fc9.png" style="width:43.17em;height:47.58em;" width="780" height="860"/></div>
<p>Some people are afraid of connecting Kali to the network, because it's open to personal computers. If you're anxious about it, you can choose <span class="packt_screen">NAT</span> or <span class="packt_screen">NAT Network</span> (on VirtualBox). If you're using VirtualBox, then use an NAT Network instead of NAT, because an NAT Network will automatically assign IP addresses (see the section of <em>Installing Kali on VirtualBox</em> for more details on the implementation of this architecture). When you choose <span class="packt_screen">NAT</span> (or <span class="packt_screen">NAT Network</span>), your Kali host will be assigned a different set of IP addresses. For example, if your home network IP addresses use the range of <kbd>192.168.0.0</kbd>, then with NAT, you should use a different <strong>virtual LAN</strong> (<strong><span>VLAN</span></strong>), such as <kbd>10.0.0.0</kbd>:</p>

<p>An Internal Network is for particular people, who want the machine to be completely isolated from LAN and WAN. You're probably asking yourself the following question: what is the purpose of all this? You will use this architecture if you know ahead of time that you're testing a VM with malware installed on it. Also, this architecture is used by security professionals when they interact with a <strong>C</strong><span><strong>apture the Flag</strong> (</span><strong>CTF</strong>) machine that they don't trust:</p>

<p>Before you start using your Kali Linux machine, you need to make sure that you're up to date. The command to update Kali Linux is straightforward, and you will get used to it, since you will have to execute it at least once a week, or before installing any new application:</p>
<pre><strong>apt-get update</strong><br/><strong>apt-get upgrade -y</strong><br/><strong>reboot</strong></pre>
<p>The <kbd>-y</kbd> in the <kbd>upgrade</kbd> command will accept the prompts automatically. You will not need to press the letter <em>Y</em> every time the upgrade asks you a question.</p>
<p>You are probably curious to know where the configuration file for the update repositories is located in Kali. The path to the configuration file is <kbd>/etc/apt/sources.list</kbd> (the <kbd>#</kbd> at the beginning of a line means it's commented):</p>

<p>At this stage, you're ready to start using Kali Linux. In the next chapter, you will take your skills to the next level by starting to master the use of this operating system.</p>
<p>I like to keep the summary short and not bore you with useless details. I hope that you enjoyed this chapter, and that you learned how to download and install Kali Linux from scratch. I'm assuming that you learned how to install Kali on VMware, or VirtualBox; don't forget to install the additional tools for both.</p>
<p>As a final note, don't forget to update your Kali Linux host before moving onto the next chapter.</p>
