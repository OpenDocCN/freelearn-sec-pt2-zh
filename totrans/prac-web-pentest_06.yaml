    There are a lot of considerations to think about before starting your penetration
    test activities. Be ready to work closely with a local lawyer to help you achieve
    this phase successfully and to avoid legal action against you in the future if
    you're a free lance consultant. If you're an employee and belong to the security
    team of your company, then you don't need a lawyer, in fact, you just need the
    approval of your manager.
