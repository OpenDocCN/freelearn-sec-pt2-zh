- en: This book is a comprehensive guide on the privilege escalation process for Windows
    and Linux systems and is designed to be practical and hands-on by providing you
    with real-world exercises and scenarios in the form of vulnerable environments
    and virtual machines. The book starts off by introducing you to privilege escalation
    and covers the process of setting up a hands-on virtual hacking lab that will
    be used to demonstrate the practical aspects of the techniques covered during
    the course of this book. Each chapter of this book builds on the previous chapter
    and validates the learning process by providing you with exercises and scenarios
    that you can replicate.

    system, utilize manual and automated enumeration tools, elevate privileges on
    Windows systems by leveraging various techniques, such as impersonation attacks
    or kernel exploits, among many others, and elevate privileges on Linux systems
    through the use of kernel exploits or by exploiting SUID binaries.

- en: This book is sorted into three sections that build on each other, whereby the
    first section covers the introduction to privilege escalation, the process of
    obtaining the initial foothold on a target system, and enumerating information
    from target systems. The next two sections are dedicated to covering the various
    privilege escalation techniques and tools for both Windows and Linux systems.

    from target systems, identify potential vulnerabilities, and utilize manual techniques
    or automated tools in order to elevate their privileges on the target system.
