  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A kernel is a computer program that is the core of an operating system and has
    complete control over every resource and hardware on a system. It acts as a translation
    layer between hardware and software and facilitates the communication between
    these two layers.
  prefs: []

    during the system startup process and is responsible for handling the remaining

    are, and its role in an operating system, it becomes clear that a vulnerability
    within the kernel can be exploited and can potentially lead to privileged access
    and control over a system. It is for this reason that kernel exploits are valued
    by attackers during the privilege escalation process, as they offer a straightforward
    path for elevating privileges.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is to be noted, however, that kernel exploits can be unstable and may lead
    to system crashes and therefore need to be executed with tact and care. This is
    primarily because kernel exploits target the kernel and its functionality, therefore
    interfering with the core operation of the operating system as a whole. Consequently,
    system crashes caused by kernel exploits can lead to data loss and damage the
    operating system as a whole, which can become a liability during a penetration
    test.
