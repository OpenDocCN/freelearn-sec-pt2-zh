    administrative tasks and streamline complex processes in the world of Windows
    environments. Originally released by Microsoft in 2006, PowerShell quickly gained
    popularity among IT professionals, system administrators, and developers for its
    extensive capabilities and ease of use. Often referred to as a **command-line
    shell** or **task automation framework**, PowerShell extends beyond traditional
    shells by combining a command-line interface with a scripting language. As a standard
    programming language, PowerShell supports the following constructs:'

    with Windows system components and third-party libraries. Its syntax and scripting
    capabilities borrow from popular languages such as C#, making it approachable
    for developers familiar with the Microsoft ecosystem. However, even those without
    extensive programming knowledge can harness PowerShell’s power thanks to its intuitive
    scripting model.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'One of PowerShell’s standout features is its ability to manage objects and
    manipulate structured data easily. Unlike traditional shell scripting languages
    that primarily deal with text streams, PowerShell treats information as objects
    with properties and methods. This object-oriented approach simplifies data manipulation
    and enables complex operations with minimal code. PowerShell also boasts an extensive
    set of cmdlets, which are pre-built commands for performing a wide range of system
    management tasks. With a vast array of cmdlets available out of the box, users
    can execute tasks such as file management, process control, registry manipulation,
    and network configuration, all without needing to write custom code from scratch.
    Moreover, PowerShell is not limited to Windows systems alone. With the advent
    of **PowerShell Core** (also known as **PowerShell 7**), Microsoft extended support
    to macOS, Linux, and other platforms, making it a truly cross-platform solution.
    For this book, we will focus on PowerShell 7\. PowerShell 7 can be found at the

    testing. Its ability to interact with COM objects, query WMI data, leverage .NET
    assemblies, and perform various tasks with .NET functionality provides penetration
    testers with a wide range of capabilities for identifying vulnerabilities and
    weaknesses in target systems. From gathering system and network information using
    WMI and automating tasks with COM objects to utilizing .NET for cryptographic
    operations and network-related tasks, PowerShell is a versatile scripting language
    that empowers penetration testers to conduct comprehensive security assessments
    and identify potential security risks. Understanding how to effectively use PowerShell
    for COM, WMI, and .NET operations enhances the penetration tester’s toolkit and
    allows for more efficiency against real-world attacks.
