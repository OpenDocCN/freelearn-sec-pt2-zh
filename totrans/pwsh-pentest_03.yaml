    IP addresses to devices, acting as their digital identities. IPv4 and IPv6 are
    the primary versions. IPv4, with its 32-bit address space, has been widely used,
    but IPv6’s larger 128-bit address space addresses the address exhaustion issue.

    between devices. It segments data into packets, assigns sequence numbers, and
    establishes a connection before transmitting data. Acknowledgments and retransmissions
    ensure data integrity. TCP’s sliding window mechanism optimizes data flow control,
    enabling error recovery and proper sequencing. This protocol is crucial for applications
    where accuracy and integrity are paramount, such as web browsing, file transfers,
    and email communication.'

    enabling them to communicate and exchange data across the internet or a local
    network. It functions like a digital postal address, allowing data packets to
    be routed to the correct destination.

    periods, each set ranging from **0** to **255** (e.g., **192.168.1.1**). IPv6,
    the newer version, employs a more extensive hexadecimal format with eight groups
    of characters separated by colons, offering a virtually limitless supply of unique
    addresses (e.g., **2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334**).

    the internet. When you type a website’s domain name into your browser, a DNS server
    converts it into the corresponding IP address to locate the website’s server and
    retrieve its content. Additionally, IP addresses aid in various network operations
    such as identifying devices, managing network traffic, and enhancing security
    measures.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Port numbers play a crucial role in the TCP/IP protocol suite, facilitating
    organized and efficient communication between devices over networks. In the TCP/IP
    model, data transmission is broken down into packets, and port numbers serve as
    identifiers for specific applications or services running on devices. They ensure
    that data packets are directed to the correct application, allowing multiple services
    to operate simultaneously on a single device without interference.

    (**0** – **1023**), registered ports (**1024** – **49151**), and dynamic or private
    ports (**49152** – **65535**). Well-known ports are associated with widely used
    services such as HTTP (port **80**), HTTPS (port **443**), FTP (port **21**),
    and SMTP (port **25**). Registered ports are used for a variety of applications,
    while dynamic ports are used for temporary purposes, such as client-server communication.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When data is sent between devices, the sending device attaches a source port
    number and a destination port number to each data packet. The destination port
    number guides the receiving device in determining which application or service
    should handle the incoming data. This dual-port mechanism enables devices to maintain
    multiple ongoing communications simultaneously, ensuring that data arrives at
    the correct destination.

    sends a request to the web server’s IP address using the HTTP protocol, typically
    on port **80**. The web server, in turn, responds with the requested content,
    sending it back to the source port on the user’s device. This bidirectional communication
    is orchestrated using port numbers.

    range of DNS operations directly from their scripts or commands. With its methods
    for resolving hostnames to IP addresses, retrieving detailed host information,
    and obtaining the local hostname, the class proves invaluable for network troubleshooting,
    penetration testing, and DNS-related tasks. While it might not cover all aspects
    of DNS operations, the **System.Net.Dns** class serves as a reliable and efficient
    tool to streamline DNS interactions within the PowerShell environment. As with
    any tool, it’s essential to handle exceptions gracefully and consider ethical
    considerations, especially when conducting network-related activities. By harnessing
    the capabilities of the **System.Net.Dns** class, PowerShell users can enhance
    their ability to gather information, diagnose issues, and effectively manage DNS-related
    tasks in a variety of scenarios.
