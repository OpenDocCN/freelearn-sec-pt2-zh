    to build, deploy, and scale applications with high performance, security, and
    reliability, flexibly and cost-effectively. PowerShell is a powerful scripting
    language and automation framework that seamlessly integrates with AWS, enabling
    robust governance capabilities. AWS governance involves establishing policies,
    managing resources, and ensuring compliance across the cloud infrastructure. PowerShell
    facilitates these tasks through its *AWS Tools for PowerShell* module, providing
    cmdlets that interact with AWS services.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To enforce governance, administrators can use PowerShell scripts to create and
    enforce AWS IAM policies. This involves managing user permissions, roles, and
    access policies to ensure the principle of least privilege. PowerShell can be
    leveraged to automate the creation, modification, and deletion of IAM entities,
    streamlining user management.
  prefs: []

    PowerShell. Administrators can script resource-sharing configurations, ensuring
    resources are shared securely across accounts. PowerShell scripts can automate
    the management of resource shares, controlling access to shared resources effectively.

    Explorer. Administrators can create and manage budgets, monitor cost trends, and
    generate reports to ensure expenses align with organizational objectives. By automating
    these tasks, PowerShell helps organizations proactively manage their AWS spending.
  prefs: []

    compliance, can be managed through PowerShell. Administrators can script the creation
    and enforcement of these rules, ensuring continuous monitoring and adherence to
    organizational standards.

- en: In conclusion, PowerShell is a crucial tool for AWS governance by providing
    automation capabilities for IAM management, RAM configurations, cost monitoring,
    and compliance enforcement through AWS Config rules. Its versatility empowers
    administrators to manage and govern AWS resources efficiently, promoting a secure,
    cost-effective, and compliant cloud environment.
