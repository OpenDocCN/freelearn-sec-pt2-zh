- en: In this section, we will move on to a new topic. We will start with the malware
    development process and how you can create your own malware using Python. The
    ability to create your own malware is a very important aspect of ethical hacking.
    In [*Chapter 6*](B14788_06_Final_JC_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor130), *Malware Development*,
    we will use socket programming to create a very basic malware remote access tool.
    This will allow you to develop malware that can be used to hack into victim machines.
    In [*Chapter 7*](B14788_07_Final_JC_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor152), *Advanced Malware*,
    we will develop more advanced features in the malware such as the ability to steal
    sensitive files from victim machines, and so on. In [*Chapter 8*](B14788_08_Final_JC_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor160),
    *Post Exploitation*, we will discuss the aspects of post-exploitation, that is,
    things to do on a victim machine once you have gained access to it. The final
    chapter deals with system protection â€“ how you can protect your system from getting
    attacked and what weaknesses hackers exploit to take control of your system. We
    will also discuss how you can make your malware persistent and gain control of
    the victim machine whenever you want.
