    attacks. This is the offensive side of attacks. However, in real-life hacking,
    you need to know how to protect yourself against external attacks. A better understanding
    of protection mechanisms would help you to not only protect yourself, but this
    knowledge would also help you to carry out successful attacks. The first line
    of defense against external network attacks, or system attacks in general, is
    the **Intrusion Detection System** (**IDS**). IDS is an umbrella term for a lot
    of tools used for system security and protection, so we must learn about them
    in detail.

    they often do not give complete details regarding the security state of the system.
    They can be modified and even bypassed by different attacks. An important aspect
    of a host-based IDS is how up to date it is in terms of modern threat detection.
    It should constantly keep up with the modern threats and block them immediately
    if it detects them. An important feature of a host-based IDS is to keep a log
    of all critical activities occurring on a system. This can help a lot in threat
    detection and incidence response.

    In a Windows OS, Windows built-in antivirus is part of the host IDS. It monitors
    and detects any suspicious activity on the system and blocks potential threats
    from acting on a system. Along with virus detection, it also works to detect any
    tampering of critical Windows infrastructure.

    IDSes play a key role in limiting external network attacks from taking place.
    They play a role in protecting all devices present in a network. It observes network
    traffic over the whole subnet to monitor suspicious activity. It can be combined
    with firewalls to provide additional security. Sometimes, network-wide firewalls
    are part of an IDS.

    are present in the malware, and then it simply compares any new file introduced
    to the system with this byte sequence. If the byte sequence of an *unknown file*
    matches with the byte sequence present in the database, this means that the unknown
    file is most probably malicious, and it will immediately block this file. Otherwise,

    have a larger malware database. This method is only going to be as good as the
    database it has for testing. Newly written malware that has not yet been detected

    monitor the activities that a program undertakes. It defines certain scenarios
    that it regards as *normal behavior* and then looks for any anomaly in these behaviors.
    For example, a game software should not try to disable the antivirus system. Once
    a malware program tries to do something it is not supposed to, these systems flag
    these programs as suspicious and keep monitoring them until they detect that a
    program is trying to perform something it absolutely shouldn't. Once it detects
    suspicious behavior, it would either block the program altogether or generate
    a *red alert* for the administrator.

    Systems** (**IPSes**). For practical purposes, most of the time, these tasks are

    between them. Occasionally, however, you will see that IDSes and IPSes are mentioned
    separately, so you should know the difference between them.

    malware works great and most probably will not be detected by the IDS if it is
    using a signature-based approach since the malware is written by you and no signature
    exists for your program anywhere. However, modern IDSes are quite clever and after
    a couple of runs, they will start noting suspicious behaviors for which they use
    very exhaustive methods. In this section, we will try to see how we can run our
    Python executable and administrator privileges. This will help to achieve certain
    tasks on the victim's machine that a *normal* executable will not be able to do.
    For example, disabling the antivirus program on Windows, or creating an exception
    for a certain folder so that the virus scanner doesn't scan it, requires administrator
    privileges in Windows. You can't perform activities such as this with a normal
    executable.

    in the preceding screenshot links to the executable we just copied. Now, if you
    restart the PC, you will see that once the system boots up, the aforementioned
    executable will be started automatically. By way of practice, try to replicate
    the same procedure with the victim malware program. You should be able to get
    a return connection from the victim's machine when the victim boots up their computer.

  zh: 总结
- en: In this chapter, we learned different system protection techniques. We started
    by getting an understanding of system protection and how different IDSes/IPSes
    work. We learned about different types of detection mechanisms. We also learned
    about using executables with elevated privileges. Finally, we learned how to make
    our executables persistent. This knowledge, combined with things you learned in
    previous chapters, will allow you to develop your malware tools without being
    easily detected. As long as you keep the impact of your malware on the system
    low, it would not be easy for an IDS to detect your malware. I hope you learned
    a lot and enjoyed this book! Remember that cybersecurity is an everchanging field
    and you need to be constantly up to date with modern tools in order to become
    a successful penetration tester.

  zh: 在这一章中，我们学习了不同的系统保护技术。我们首先了解了系统保护以及不同的入侵检测系统（IDS）/入侵防御系统（IPS）的工作原理。我们学习了不同类型的检测机制。我们还学习了如何使用具有提升权限的可执行文件。最后，我们学习了如何使我们的可执行文件持久化。这些知识，结合你在之前章节学到的内容，将使你能够开发出不易被检测的恶意软件工具。只要你保持恶意软件对系统的影响较低，IDS就不容易检测到你的恶意软件。希望你学到了很多并且喜欢这本书！请记住，网络安全是一个不断变化的领域，你需要时刻与现代工具保持同步，才能成为一名成功的渗透测试人员。
