			<p>Ethical hacking is a vast field, and with the increased need for cybersecurity in modern organizations, the demand for ethical hackers and penetration testers is increasing rapidly. This book aims to get you started on your journey in cybersecurity. Python is a general-purpose programming language that was developed by Guido van Rossum in 1991. Since then, it has gained an enormous fanbase. Python is consistently ranked as the most preferred and most powerful programming language by hackers, and being able to use it for penetration testing is a highly desired skill for professionals. There is so much to learn about cybersecurity that it takes many years of experience to get the hang of things in this field. There is hardly any other field that changes as rapidly as cybersecurity. In this book, we will start our journey by learning about the basics of hacking, and later in the book, we will focus on learning how hackers build their own tools.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>This book is intended for people who want to learn about ethical hacking by developing tools themselves instead of just using prebuilt tools; you will learn how to build hacking tools from scratch. This book is also intended for Python developers who want to dive into the world of ethical hacking.</p>
