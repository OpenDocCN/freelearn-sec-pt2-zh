- en: Ethical hacking is a vast field, and with the increased need for cybersecurity
    in modern organizations, the demand for ethical hackers and penetration testers
    is increasing rapidly. This book aims to get you started on your journey in cybersecurity.
    Python is a general-purpose programming language that was developed by Guido van
    Rossum in 1991\. Since then, it has gained an enormous fanbase. Python is consistently
    ranked as the most preferred and most powerful programming language by hackers,
    and being able to use it for penetration testing is a highly desired skill for
    professionals. There is so much to learn about cybersecurity that it takes many
    years of experience to get the hang of things in this field. There is hardly any
    other field that changes as rapidly as cybersecurity. In this book, we will start
    our journey by learning about the basics of hacking, and later in the book, we
    will focus on learning how hackers build their own tools.
