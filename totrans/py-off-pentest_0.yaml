- en: Python is an easy-to-learn cross-platform programming language that has unlimited
    third-party libraries. Plenty of open source hacking tools are written in Python
    and can be easily integrated within your script. This book is divided into clear
    bite-size chunks, so you can learn at your own pace and focus on the areas that
    are of most interest to you. You will learn how to code your own scripts and master
    ethical hacking from scratch.
