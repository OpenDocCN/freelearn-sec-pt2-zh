- en: Cybersecurity is one of the most interesting topics and demanding fields in
    the world. As the world continues to evolve, the same can be said for our technological
    advances to help humans improve the way they perform tasks. However, there are
    many systems and networks around us that contain hidden security weaknesses that
    are taken advantage of by adversaries such as hackers. As a cybersecurity author
    and lecturer, I’ve heard from many professionals, enthusiasts, and students about
    the importance of finding a book that guides the reader to thoroughly understand
    how to efficiently perform reconnaissance techniques and procedures to identify
    and reduce the attack surface of their organizations.

- en: Reconnaissance is the first phase of any cyber-attack performed by an adversary.
    The attacker needs to understand the infrastructure of the target, identify whether
    any security vulnerabilities exist and how to exploit them, and what attack vectors
    can be used to carry out the attack on the target. Without such intelligence about
    the target, the hacker will experience difficulties in compromising the potential
    victim. As an aspiring ethical hacker, it’s essential to understand the **Tactics,
    Techniques, and Procedures** (**TTPs**) that are commonly used by real hackers
    to discover hidden security vulnerabilities and apply those TTPs to help improve
    the cyber defenses of your organization.

    internet without realizing how such data can be leveraged by a threat actor in
    planning a future attack on their target. Learning reconnaissance-based techniques
    and procedures helps ethical hackers to identify how organizations are leaking
    data, determine the potential impact and cyber-risk to an organization if an attacker
    were to leverage the leaked data to execute a cyber-attack, and how to mitigate
    and implement countermeasures to improve the cyber defenses of the company.

    content, and one of the most important elements of being an ethical hacker and
    penetration tester is the need to keep up to date with the ever-changing cybersecurity
    landscape. There are new tools, techniques, and procedures that are being developed
    and used by cybersecurity professionals in the industry to ensure they are at
    least one step ahead of cyber-criminals and help secure their organizations’ assets.
    As a result, ethical hackers and penetration testers need to be well equipped
    with the latest knowledge, techniques, skills, and tools to efficiently perform
    reconnaissance-based attacks and **Open Source Intelligence** (**OSINT**) penetration
    testing to determine the attack surface of their organization.

- en: During the writing process of this book, I’ve used a student-centric and learner-friendly
    approach to ensure all readers are able to easily understand the most complex
    topics, terminologies, and why there is a need to identify security vulnerabilities
    in organizations, systems, and networks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book begins by introducing you to the importance of reconnaissance and
    how both cybersecurity professionals and adversaries use it to identify vulnerable
    points of entry in a company. Then, you’ll be taken through an exciting journey
    learning how to apply reconnaissance-based TTPs that are commonly used by adversaries
    to efficiently collect and analyze publicly available data to create a profile
    about their targets’ systems and network infrastructure. You will learn how to
    set up a sock puppet and anonymize your internet-based traffic to conceal your
    identity as an ethical hacker to reduce your threat level during reconnaissance
    assessments.

    themselves and how adversaries can leverage it to improve their cyber-attacks
    and threats. You’ll also learn how to leverage OSINT and common tools to identify
    exposed systems and networks within organizations, gather leaked employees’ credentials,
    and perform wireless signals intelligence to better understand how a potential
    hacker can compromise their targets.

- en: In addition, you will gain hands-on skills in performing active reconnaissance
    to identify live systems, open ports, running services, and operating systems,
    and perform vulnerability assessments to identify how an attacker can identify
    security vulnerabilities on a system and what organizations can do to mitigate
    the threat. Furthermore, you’ll learn how to identify the attack surface of a
    target’s website and infrastructure and discover additional assets owned by the
    same target. Lastly, you’ll discover how to leverage Wireshark and popular open
    source tools to identify reconnaissance-based attacks and threats on a network
    as a cybersecurity professional.

    beginner to expert by learning, understanding, and developing your reconnaissance-based
    skills in ethical hacking and penetration testing as an aspiring cybersecurity
    professional in the industry.

    in networking, such as understanding common network and application protocols
    of the TCP/IP, IP addressing, routing and switching concepts, and the roles and
    functions of networking devices and security appliances. Knowledge of virtualization
    technologies such as hypervisors and their components will be beneficial as most
    labs are built within a virtualized environment to reduce the need to purchase
    additional systems.
