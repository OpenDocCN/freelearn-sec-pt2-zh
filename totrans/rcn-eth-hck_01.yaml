- en: As an aspiring ethical hacker, penetration tester, or red teamer, reconnaissance
    plays an important role in helping cybersecurity professionals reduce organizations’
    digital footprint on the internet. These digital footprints enable adversaries
    such as hackers to leverage publicly available information about a target to plan
    future operations and cyber-attacks. As more organizations and users are connecting
    their systems and networks to the largest network infrastructure in the world,
    the internet, access to information and the sharing of resources are readily available
    to everyone. The internet has provided the platform for many organizations to
    extend their products and services beyond traditional borders to potential and
    new customers around the world. Furthermore, people are using the internet to
    enroll and attend online classes, perform e-commerce transactions, operate online
    businesses, and communicate and share ideas with others.

    an organization is looking to hire an employee to fill a new or existing role,
    the recruiter simply posts the job vacancy with all the necessary details that
    are needed for an interested candidate. This enables anyone with internet access
    to visit various job forums and recruiting websites to seek new career opportunities
    and easily submit an application via the online platform. Information that’s posted
    and available online enables adversaries to collect and leverage specific details
    about the targeted organization. Such details help hackers to determine the type
    of network infrastructure, systems, and services that are running on the internal
    network of a company without breaking in. This book will teach you all about how
    threat actors and ethical hackers are able to leverage publicly available information
    in planning future operations that lead to a cyber-attack.

- en: The term *hacking* is commonly used to describe the techniques and activities
    that are performed by a person with malicious intentions, such as a *hacker*,
    to gain unauthorized access to a system or network. Since the early days of telephone
    systems, computers, and the internet, many people have developed a high level
    of interest in determining how various devices and technologies operate and work
    together. It’s quite fascinating that a person can use a traditional landline
    telephone to dial the telephone number of another person and establish a connection
    for a verbal conversation. Or even using a computer to send an email message to
    someone else, where the email message can be delivered to the intended recipient’s
    mailbox almost instantaneously compared to traditional postal operations.

    system to further understand its functions created the foundation of hacking.
    Early generations of hackers sought to understand how systems and devices work,
    and whether there was any flaw in the design that could be taken advantage of
    to alter the original function of the system. For instance, during the 1950s and
    1960s in the United States, a security vulnerability was found in a telephone
    system that enabled users to manipulate/alter telephone signals to allow free
    long-distance calls. This technique was known as **phreaking** in the telecommunication
    industry. Specifically, a person could use whistles that operated at 2600 MHz
    to recreate signals that were used as the telephone routing signals, thus enabling
    free long-distance calling to anyone who exploited this flaw. However, telecommunication
    providers had implemented a solution known as **Common Channel Interoffice Signaling**
    (**CCIS**) that separated the signals from the voice channel. In this scenario,
    people discovered a security vulnerability in a system and exploited it to alter
    the operation of the system. However, the intention varied from one person to
    another, whether for fun, experimental, or even to gain free long-distance calling.

    into another system or network. There are various motives behind each hacker,
    for instance, many hackers will break into systems for fun, to prove a point to
    others, to steal data from organizations, for financial gain by selling stolen
    data on the dark web, or even as a personal challenge. Whatever the reason is,
    hacking is illegal around the world as it involves using a computing system to
    cause harm or damage to another system.

    professionals such as ethical hackers and penetration testers use similar techniques
    and tools to simulate real-world cyber-attacks on organizations’ networks with
    legal permission and intent to discover and resolve hidden security vulnerabilities
    before real cyber-attacks occur in the future. Ethical hackers are simply good
    people and are commonly referred to as *white-hat hackers* in the cybersecurity
    industry, who use their knowledge and skills to help organizations find and resolve
    their hidden security weaknesses and flaws prior to a real cyber-attack. Although
    threat actors and ethical hackers have similar skill sets, they have different
    moral compasses, with threat actors using their skills and abilities for malicious
    and illegal purposes and ethical hackers using their skills to help organizations
    defend themselves and safeguard their assets from malicious hackers.

    procedures that are used by the ethical hacker to collect as much information
    as possible about the target to determine their network infrastructure, cyber
    defenses, and security vulnerabilities that can be compromised to gain unauthorized
    access and improve attack operations accordingly. From a military perspective,
    reconnaissance plays an important role in planning and launching an attack on
    a target. Collecting information about the target helps the attacker to determine
    the points of entry, type of infrastructure, assets owned, and the target’s strengths
    and weaknesses.

    of an organization’s systems and network infrastructure before launching an attack.
    The collected information can be leveraged to identify any security vulnerabilities
    that can be exploited, thus enabling the ethical hacker to compromise and gain
    a foothold in the targeted systems. For instance, using reconnaissance techniques
    enables the ethical hacker to identify any running services and open ports and
    the service and software versions on a system, all of which can be used to identify
    and determine potential attack vectors on the target.

    (**OSINT**) enables the ethical hacker to passively collect information about
    their target that’s publicly available on the internet. Such information may contain
    usernames, email addresses, and job titles of employees of the targeted organization.
    This information can be leveraged to create various *social engineering* attacks
    and *phishing* email campaigns that are sent to specific employees within the
    targeted company.

    let’s imagine there’s an employee whose name is John Doe and his email address
    is **jdoe@companyname.com** and another employee is Jane Foster with an email
    address of **jfoster@companyname.com**. This information shows a pattern and format
    for employees within the same organization: **{f}{lastname}@domain-name.com**,
    where **f** is the initial letter of the person’s first name followed by their
    last name and the company’s domain name. Such information can help an ethical
    hacker to send phishing email campaigns to specific email addresses of high-profile
    employees of the targeted organization.'

    a threat actor and improve their cyber defenses. By enabling an ethical hacker
    to perform reconnaissance techniques and procedures on an organization’s systems
    and network infrastructure, the organization can efficiently identify security
    vulnerabilities and take the necessary measures to remediate and resolve them
    before they are discovered and exploited by adversaries. Furthermore, reconnaissance
    helps organizations to both identify and keep track of potential threat actors,
    enabling the company to gain a better understanding of the cybersecurity threat
    landscape while implementing and improving proactive countermeasures to safeguard
    their assets, systems, and networks. Hence, reconnaissance is not only important
    to adversaries but cybersecurity professionals use the gathered information to

    are created by the ethical hacker. If the security team were unable to detect
    any actions that were performed during the ethical hacking and penetration testing
    assessment, it’s a good sign for the ethical hacker as their techniques were stealthy
    enough to bypass and evade any threat detection systems on the network. However,
    this means the organization’s security team needs to improve their threat monitoring
    and detection strategies and tune their sensors to catch any security-related

    running services and open ports on a server, the ethical hacker can use a network
    and port scanning tool such as **Nmap** to perform host discovery on a network.

    that can be exploited to gain access to a system, network, and organization using
    attack vectors. If organizations are unable to identify their security vulnerabilities
    and implement countermeasures, they are simply leaving themselves susceptible
    and exposed to cyber-attacks and threats. **Attack Surface Management** (**ASM**)
    is not a new study in the cybersecurity industry, rather it’s a new focus for
    cybersecurity professionals and organizations around the world. ASM is a strategy
    that’s used by cybersecurity professionals that enables them to focus on identifying,
    analyzing, and reducing the attack surface of an organization. As a result, by
    reducing the attack surface of an organization, it reduces the risk of being compromised
    by cyber-attacks and threats while safeguarding its assets, resources, and sensitive
    information.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    prioritize security vulnerabilities based on their vulnerability score and potential
    impact. The **Common Vulnerability Scoring System** (**CVSS**) is commonly referenced
    within many vulnerability scanning tools to provide vulnerability of between **0**
    and **10**, where **0** is the least impact and **10** is critical. These scores
    help cybersecurity professionals to apply high priority and resources to remediate
    security vulnerabilities with higher severity.

    that are less critical to the operation of the business but have a greater potential
    impact if they’re exploited by a threat actor. Therefore, ASM helps organizations
    in prioritizing security vulnerabilities based on their impact levels while allocating
    their resources to remediating the most critical security vulnerabilities first.

- en: Additionally, organizations that implement ASM are able to better identify and
    track changes to their attack surfaces. For instance, if an organization installs
    a new update to an existing system, this new update could introduce new security
    vulnerabilities and potentially change the attack surface, enabling a threat actor
    to use new techniques to compromise the system. Similarly, if an organization
    implements a new system or application on its network infrastructure, it has the
    potential of bringing new security flaws to the attack surface. However, ASM enables
    cybersecurity professionals to track changes that are being made to the attack
    surface of the organization while ensuring the security team is aware of any new
    security vulnerabilities that are introduced during this process. Furthermore,
    the organization can take the necessary actions to remediate these security vulnerabilities
    before they can be exploited by a threat actor.

    monitor their attack surface and identify any suspicious activities. This improves
    real-time threat detection and response within the company, enabling the security
    team to take immediate action to prevent, contain, or remediate the threat from
    systems and networks. Lastly, when ASM is implemented properly, it helps security
    teams to identify whether any malicious activities or threats that evaded security
    solutions have gone undetected on their systems and networks.

    an organization, they need to perform reconnaissance to gather as much information
    as possible on the target to determine its attack surface (points of entry). While
    there are many techniques that are used by both threat actors and ethical hackers,
    MITRE has created its well-known **MITRE ATT&CK** framework, which outlines the
    **Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures** (**TTPs**) of adversaries that are based
    on real-world events. These TTPs are commonly used by cybersecurity professionals,
    researchers, and organizations to both develop and improve their threat modeling
    and cyber defenses.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the methods that are used by adversaries to collect information about their targets
    prior to launching an attack. These TTPs are also used by ethical hackers to efficiently
    identify security vulnerabilities and how a threat actor could compromise the
    attack surface of their client’s network infrastructure.

    tools to collect information about the target that can be leveraged in future
    operations. These scanning tools send special probes to targeted systems and networks
    to determine live hosts, operating systems, open ports, and running services on
    the host machine. Active scanning is an active reconnaissance technique that involves
    scanning IP network blocks and public IP addresses of the target, vulnerability
    scanning to identify security weaknesses that can be exploited, and wordlist scanning
    to retrieve possible passwords for future password-based attacks against the target.'
