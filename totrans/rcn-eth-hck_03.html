			<h1 id="_idParaDest-45"><a id="_idTextAnchor044"/>Understanding Passive Reconnaissance</h1>
			<p>As more people and organizations are connecting to the largest network in the world, the internet is becoming a massive storage medium. Lots of people are uploading various types of data on many websites and online platforms. While the internet is known as the <em class="italic">information super-highway</em>, enabling people around the world to share information and collaborate, it has become a medium for storing data about people, organizations, systems, and networks. Such information can be leveraged by adversaries with malicious intent to plan future cyber-attacks on a target. As an aspiring ethical hacker, it’s important to understand how adversaries are able to discover and leverage publicly available information to create a profile of their target and improve their strategies and techniques in their <span class="No-Break">cyber operations.</span></p>
			<p>During the course of this chapter, you will learn about the fundamentals and importance of passive reconnaissance and the best practices that are used by industry experts such as ethical hackers and penetration testers, as well as how these techniques are aligned with adversaries. Furthermore, you will explore the fundamentals of <strong class="bold">Open Source Intelligence</strong> (<strong class="bold">OSINT</strong>) and how it helps organizations to reduce their attack surface. Additionally, you will also learn how to efficiently conceal your online identity as an ethical hacker when performing passive reconnaissance and how to anonymize your <span class="No-Break">internet traffic.</span></p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-47"><a id="_idTextAnchor046"/>Exploring passive reconnaissance</h1>
			<p>As time goes on, the internet is becoming a more valuable resource every day to many people and <a id="_idIndexMarker202"/>organizations, helping everyone to collaborate and share ideas with others beyond traditional borders. The internet was originally referred to as an information super-highway, enabling a user with an internet connection and a computer to easily visit websites, participate in online forums and communities, and perform e-commerce transactions without visiting a traditional <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">brick-and-mortar</em></span><span class="No-Break"> store.</span></p>
			<p>In today’s world, smartphones with a data plan enable a user to easily access the internet and its resources within a few seconds. For instance, imagine you’re looking to advance your career in the cybersecurity industry and want to identify any organization that’s hiring professionals within your region. Using the web browser on your smartphone and Google Search, you can quickly research the top cybersecurity organizations within your region, check their career portal, and explore their hiring process. Additionally, you can further determine the mission, vision, core values, interviewing process and panel, and job responsibilities and requirements of a suitable candidate. However, some organizations leak too much data in their job posts, which is leveraged by threat actors in planning <span class="No-Break">future cyber-attacks.</span></p>
			<p>Every day, many people around the world use the internet and upload documents, audio, video, and other file types. This data is not automatically erased from the internet when a user decides to delete it. For instance, the <strong class="bold">Internet Archive</strong> is a public digital library <a id="_idIndexMarker203"/>that indexes and keeps a record of everything it knows on the internet for the past 20 years. To put it simply, if you upload or create anything on the internet and delete it after, it’s not erased from the internet because it can be <a id="_idIndexMarker204"/>retrieved using the <strong class="bold">Wayback Machine</strong> on the Internet Archive to view historical data on the internet. Hence, threat actors leverage data collected from the Internet Archive about their targets to improve <span class="No-Break">their attacks.</span></p>
			<p>The following figure <a id="_idIndexMarker205"/>shows the Wayback Machine, which allows anyone to insert a <strong class="bold">Uniform Resource Locator</strong> (<strong class="bold">URL</strong>) within the <span class="No-Break">search field:</span></p>

			<p>Data privacy is a major concern around the world as more people, organizations, and governments are becoming more aware of the impact of confidential data being available to anyone with malicious intentions, such as adversaries and other threat actors. There are many data privacy concerns when visiting websites, such as whether users’ data is being <a id="_idIndexMarker207"/>collected and how it’s going to be used by the website owner. For instance, some websites do not have any security protection for their users and will transmit data between the web server and the user’s web browser in plaintext, enabling an adversary to intercept and capture any sensitive data. For instance, websites insert cookies into the visitor’s web browser, which enables the website to track the visitor’s activities and information about the user while improving the user experience. If a threat actor were to capture and analyze the data found within cookies, the adversary will be able to retrieve <strong class="bold">session IDs</strong> and determine the user’s web activities. If the user is authenticated on the website, the session ID enables the threat actor to gain <a id="_idIndexMarker208"/>unauthorized access to the victim’s account on the same website without knowing the victim’s <span class="No-Break">user credentials.</span></p>
			<p>With the growth of the internet came many social media websites, which enable people to digitally connect and share updates with their family, friends, and co-workers using an online digital platform. Social media platforms have grown a lot over the past decade as many people and organizations use these platforms to start online communities, advertise their products and services, and share news and updates. While social media websites encourage everyone to connect with each other, it’s important to understand these websites create a <strong class="bold">web of people</strong> who are linked to each other with a mutual connection. For instance, when you visit someone’s profile on a social media platform as a logged-in user, the platform shows your mutual connections or friends. If you click on a mutual contact, you’re redirected to the person’s profile where you may see additional mutual connections or friends, which creates a digital web of people who are interconnected in <span class="No-Break">some way.</span></p>
			<p>While social media platforms help people stay connected digitally, some people's online profiles may be <a id="_idIndexMarker209"/>less secure than others, leaking your data to threat actors. For instance, if you do not use social media and others do, you may appear in pictures that are posted by your family, friends, or co-workers with less secure profile. This provides the opportunity for a threat actor to use facial recognition to determine the identity of a person from a picture and use Google Images to perform <strong class="bold">reverse image searches</strong> to identify any websites that contain similar pictures to determine the identity or location of someone <span class="No-Break">or something.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">To learn more about advanced Google searching, please refer to <a href="B19448_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor060"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a><em class="italic">, Domain and DNS Intelligence</em>.

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.2 – Google Images</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">Google Images leverages <strong class="bold">Google Lens</strong>, an advanced image recognition technology, to help identify <a id="_idIndexMarker210"/>location, text, <span class="No-Break">and objects.</span></p>
			<p>There are many data sources that threat actors and ethical hackers use to collect information about organizations and people. <strong class="bold">Data brokers</strong> are organizations that buy, collect, analyze, and sell data about people and organizations without first gaining permission. Data brokers often <a id="_idIndexMarker211"/>sell data to anyone such as advertising agencies, people search engines, financial institutions, and marketing companies around the world. Data brokers collect <a id="_idIndexMarker212"/>data from many sources, including tracking information found within website cookies that are placed on users’ web browsers, usage information collected from mobile applications that are installed on smartphones and tablets, and public information that is found on <span class="No-Break">the internet.</span></p>
			<p>Data brokers analyze and process the collected data to create profiles and dossiers on millions of people around the world, including their activities, preferences and dislikes, travel and health status, and residential location. The availability of such public information can be leveraged by a threat actor who is targeting a user, group of people, <span class="No-Break">or organization.</span></p>
			<p>Thus, so far, you have gained an understanding of how the internet is currently being used as a massive storage medium for various types of data and anyone with internet connectivity will be able to access public data. This means threat actors can spend a lot of time fine-tuning their internet searches to collect specific data from various online sources, with the intent of creating a profile and understanding the attack surface of <span class="No-Break">their target.</span></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Reconnaissance</strong> is the tactics and techniques used by threat actors and ethical hackers to collect information <a id="_idIndexMarker213"/>that can be used to discover and exploit security vulnerabilities on a target. The following are the two categories <span class="No-Break">of reconnaissance:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Passive reconnaissance</strong></span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Active reconnaissance</strong></span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Passive reconnaissance is when a <a id="_idIndexMarker214"/>threat actor or ethical hacker does not directly interact with <a id="_idIndexMarker215"/>or connect to the target, and instead relies heavily upon publicly available information to collect intelligence that can be used to compromise <span class="No-Break">the target.</span></p>
			<p>The following are the key advantages of performing <span class="No-Break">passive reconnaissance:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Increasing stealth</strong>: The techniques used during passive reconnaissance ensure a threat actor or ethical <a id="_idIndexMarker216"/>hacker does not directly interact with the target. It reduces the likelihood of being detected by <span class="No-Break">security systems.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">More data sources</strong>: The internet contains a massive wealth of information that can be found on websites, social media platforms, and internet search engines and used for passive reconnaissance by <span class="No-Break">ethical hackers.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Reducing legal concerns</strong>: Since passive information gathering involves collecting data from public sources, this process does not have the same risks as active reconnaissance and it’s <span class="No-Break">generally legal.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Reducing cost</strong>: Since ethical hackers collect publicly available information from the internet to create a profile of their target, passive reconnaissance is often less expensive and does not require the same resources as compared to <span class="No-Break">active reconnaissance.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Improving safety</strong>: Since the ethical hacker is collecting publicly available information <a id="_idIndexMarker217"/>from the internet, they are at less risk of detection. Therefore, using passive reconnaissance is a safer option as compared to <span class="No-Break">active reconnaissance.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>While passive information gathering is commonly used by both threat actors and ethical hackers, there are some disadvantages, such as <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Limited data</strong>: Since passive reconnaissance leverages publicly available information, the data found may <a id="_idIndexMarker218"/>be outdated or inaccurate, and access may <span class="No-Break">be limited.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Inaccurate data</strong>: Using passive reconnaissance to collect information can lead to gathering inaccurate or misleading data about the target, which can further lead to discovering fake websites and making inaccurate conclusions. Hence, ethical hackers depend on the availability and accuracy of information collected from <span class="No-Break">the internet.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Time-consuming</strong>: The internet contains massive amounts of data. An ethical hacker may require a lot of time to locate and gather specific data about the target from various <span class="No-Break">data sources.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>However, active reconnaissance enables a threat actor or ethical hacker to directly interact with or <a id="_idIndexMarker219"/>connect to the targeted system to retrieve specific details that are unlikely to be collected during passive reconnaissance. It usually involves ethical hackers using specialized tools and techniques to send probes to determine the technical architecture of a system, operating system, running services and open ports, and security vulnerabilities. Unlike passive reconnaissance, active reconnaissance techniques are more intrusive and have a higher risk of being detected and triggering alerts by <span class="No-Break">security systems.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">Since active information-gathering techniques are intrusive, as they collect sensitive details about systems, it’s generally illegal to perform scanning on systems without first obtaining <span class="No-Break">legal permission.</span></p>
			<p>Ethical hackers and penetration testers use the same techniques as real hackers to efficiently determine the attack surface and identify security vulnerabilities and their associated security risks within organizations. Isn’t it illegal to use the same techniques to compromise systems and networks that are owned by organizations? The simple answer is yes as hacking is generally illegal. However, ethical hackers and penetration testers need to<a id="_idIndexMarker220"/> obtain legal permission from the authorities before starting any work on their client’s systems <span class="No-Break">and networks.</span></p>
			<p>The following are the benefits of why ethical hackers use the same techniques as <span class="No-Break">real hackers:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Efficiently testing the security of a system</strong>: Using the same techniques as threat actors, ethical hackers are able to efficiently test whether the security of a system is working as expected or contains possible <span class="No-Break">security flaws.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Efficiently discovering security vulnerabilities</strong>: By simulating real-world cyber-attacks on an organization’s systems, ethical hackers are able to efficiently discover hidden security vulnerabilities and recommend countermeasures to prevent or mitigate a <span class="No-Break">real cyber-attack.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Improving security awareness</strong>: Many organizations do not fully understand the impact of a cyber-attack on their systems and network. By simulating a real-world cyber-attack, the ethical hacker will be able to demonstrate the impact and severity if a real cyber-attack were to occur. Overall, it raises the importance of cybersecurity to decision-makers of <span class="No-Break">an organization.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Providing evidence</strong>: Since ethical hackers use the same techniques as real hackers to test the security of a system and discover hidden security vulnerabilities, the ethical hacker can collect solid evidence of security vulnerabilities and understand their severity risk levels, which can be used to help the organization’s security team prioritize resources to improve their <span class="No-Break">security posture.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Keeping up to date</strong>: Since there are new cyber-attacks and threats every day, ethical hackers and penetration testers always need to stay up to date on the latest techniques that are used by real hackers to efficiently test for hidden security vulnerabilities <span class="No-Break">on systems.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Discovering data leaks</strong>: Many organizations leak data about themselves, which can be leveraged by real hackers to plan future cyber-attacks on <span class="No-Break">their targets.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>To better understand what type of data should be collected and how it can be processed to <a id="_idIndexMarker221"/>create meaningful information, let’s take a look at the concept <span class="No-Break">of footprinting.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-48"><a id="_idTextAnchor047"/>Understanding footprinting</h2>
			<p>Using the internet to find and collect sensitive data about a person or organization is quite fascinating for <a id="_idIndexMarker222"/>many, especially aspiring ethical hackers and penetration testers. However, collecting tons of data about a target is meaningless if we don’t understand what we are looking for and how to process and convert it into information that’s meaningful for us to develop a profile about <span class="No-Break">a target.</span></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Footprinting</strong> is the technique used by threat actors and ethical hackers to gather specific details about a <a id="_idIndexMarker223"/>target, such as the host operating system, open ports, and running services. The information collected during footprinting can be leveraged by an ethical hacker to identify the number of security vulnerabilities that can be exploited to gain unauthorized access to a system, network, or organization. Additionally, footprinting helps ethical hackers to gain a better understanding of the security posture of an organization and <span class="No-Break">their infrastructure.</span></p>
			<p>The following diagram displays the link between footprinting <span class="No-Break">and reconnaissance:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer074" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_3.03_B19448.jpg" alt="Figure 3.3 – Footprinting"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.3 – Footprinting</p>
			<p>Data that’s collected during footprinting is generally classified into the <span class="No-Break">following categories:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break">System information</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Network information</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Organizational information</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>System information helps ethical hackers to determine what’s running on the device, such as the host operating system, running services and applications, and usernames and passwords. The <a id="_idIndexMarker224"/>ethical hacker can use the operating system <a id="_idIndexMarker225"/>information to research and identify whether the operating system is vulnerable and can be exploited. Within many organizations, there are outdated and vulnerable applications and services that are running on hosts, which creates the opportunity for an ethical hacker to identify and exploit security vulnerabilities on running services to gain unauthorized access to the target. Furthermore, ethical hackers may be able to retrieve valid user credentials, which can be used to gain unauthorized remote access to a <span class="No-Break">targeted system.</span></p>
			<p>Network information helps ethical hackers to identify whether there are any vulnerable network <a id="_idIndexMarker226"/>protocols and services running between systems <a id="_idIndexMarker227"/>on the network. Many common network protocols were <a id="_idIndexMarker228"/>not designed with security in mind, thus enabling <a id="_idIndexMarker229"/>threat actors to exploit their security <a id="_idIndexMarker230"/>weaknesses to perform cyber-attacks. An attacker can intercept and identify sensitive network information, such as <strong class="bold">Domain Name System</strong> (<strong class="bold">DNS</strong>), <strong class="bold">Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution</strong> (<strong class="bold">LLMNR</strong>), <strong class="bold">Address Resolution Protocol</strong> (<strong class="bold">ARP</strong>), domain names, sub-domain names, and firewall rules. For instance, if a threat actor were to capture DNS queries and replies, the attacker may be able to identify the organization’s DNS servers and attempt to retrieve internal hostnames and <span class="No-Break">IP addresses.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout"><strong class="bold">DNS</strong> is an application-layer <a id="_idIndexMarker231"/>protocol that enables a system <a id="_idIndexMarker232"/>to resolve the hostname to an IP address. <strong class="bold">LLMNR</strong> is a layer 2 protocol that enables systems to resolve hostnames <a id="_idIndexMarker233"/>on a <strong class="bold">Local Area Network</strong> (<strong class="bold">LAN</strong>). <strong class="bold">ARP</strong> is a network protocol that allows systems to <a id="_idIndexMarker234"/>resolve the IP <a id="_idIndexMarker235"/>address to a <strong class="bold">Media Access Control</strong> (<span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">MAC</strong></span><span class="No-Break">) address.</span></p>
			<p>Vulnerable network protocols, such as LLMNR and ARP, are susceptible to various layer 2-based attacks, which enables an attacker to intercept and inject unsolicited packets into hosts on a <a id="_idIndexMarker236"/>network. Furthermore, identifying the domain name of an organization provides focus to enumerate sub-domains. Some organizations will enforce additional security controls on their primary domain name but neglect some of their sub-domains. The attacker can identify whether compromising a vulnerable sub-domain will lead to gaining unauthorized access to the <span class="No-Break">organization’s network.</span></p>
			<p>Organizational information helps ethical hackers to identify who the employees of the company are, their <a id="_idIndexMarker237"/>contact information, such as telephone <a id="_idIndexMarker238"/>numbers and email addresses, and an organizational chart that displays high-profile employees with high-privilege user accounts. The organizational information can be leveraged when planning various social engineering attacks, such as spear-phishing email campaigns that are targeted toward the employees of <span class="No-Break">the organization.</span></p>
			<p>While there are <a id="_idIndexMarker239"/>various methodologies used by ethical hackers<a id="_idIndexMarker240"/> and threat actors, the following is a common set of guidelines for getting started with footprinting <span class="No-Break">a target:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Use internet <span class="No-Break">search engines</span></li>
				<li>Perform advanced Google searches (<span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Google hacking/dorking</strong></span><span class="No-Break">)</span></li>
				<li>Collect information from social <span class="No-Break">media websites</span></li>
				<li>Collect information from the <span class="No-Break">target’s website</span></li>
				<li>Perform footprinting on email messages originating from <span class="No-Break">the target</span></li>
				<li>Use an online domain registry to retrieve <span class="No-Break">domain information</span></li>
				<li>Perform DNS <span class="No-Break">information gathering</span></li>
				<li>Perform <span class="No-Break">network footprinting</span></li>
				<li>Performing <span class="No-Break">social engineering</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">Ethical hackers can use the Google Dork <strong class="source-inline">"login" site:microsoft.com</strong> to find login pages that are associated with the <strong class="source-inline">microsoft.com</strong> domain or s<strong class="source-inline">ite:microsoft.com AND intitle:"login"</strong> to find pages that contain the <span class="No-Break">keyword </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">login</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>You will explore the <a id="_idIndexMarker241"/>preceding techniques in the next chapter, which <a id="_idIndexMarker242"/>focuses on advanced intelligence gathering, to develop the industry skills that are needed by ethical hackers and penetration testers. Having completed this section, you have learned the fundamentals of passive information gathering and how the internet can be leveraged to collect data about a target. In the next section, you will learn the fundamentals of OSINT and how it’s used to help ethical hackers to profile <span class="No-Break">their targets.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-49"><a id="_idTextAnchor048"/>Fundamentals of OSINT</h1>
			<p>OSINT is simply the process and techniques that are used by ethical hackers to search for, collect, and analyze data that’s found on public sources such as the internet. While many people post and upload various types of data every day on the internet, ethical hackers can leverage <a id="_idIndexMarker243"/>the data on the internet to create a profile and better understand their target. While OSINT may seem to be as simple as using a search engine such as Google Search to find answers to questions, many people typically use the information and resources that are displayed on page 1 of the search results as it’s generally the most related to the search criteria. However, not many people will check the remaining pages of the search results, such as pages 2–10, to determine whether the answers to the search criteria are accurate and provide comprehensive details to <span class="No-Break">the user.</span></p>
			<p>Ethical hackers spend a lot of time collecting data from various public sources to ensure sufficient data is gathered about their targets; however, this data does not always provide meaning and context and needs to be thoroughly analyzed to create meaning, enabling ethical hackers to better understand the system details and network and organizational information about the target. Hence, it’s essential, when using internet search engines to find data, to go beyond page 1 to collect more data about the target. The idea is to <a id="_idIndexMarker244"/>collect everything, then analyze the collected data to create meaning and provide context as it relates to <span class="No-Break">the target.</span></p>
			<p>The following are <a id="_idIndexMarker245"/>common types of data that are found and available from <span class="No-Break">public sources:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Media</strong>: This includes audio, video, and pictures that are uploaded to <span class="No-Break">the internet</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Text</strong>: These are documents, articles, and blogs that are <span class="No-Break">posted online</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Maps</strong>: Geolocation data about a person <span class="No-Break">or organization</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>These common data types are usually posted directly either by the target or by others about the target and they contain useful data to better understand and profile the target. For instance, if a target posts photos about their vacation on social media, an ethical hacker can observe the details of the pictures, such as the date posted and background. The date helps the ethical hacker to determine when and how often the target visited the location, specific times when the target took a vacation, and whether there are any other patterns that can be leveraged to track the target’s movement. Furthermore, the background within each photo reveals identifying information about the physical location of where the photo was taken and enables the ethical hacker to use online search engines, such as Google Images, to perform a reverse image lookup to determine the geolocation of <span class="No-Break">the target.</span></p>
			<p>Additionally, if an ethical hacker is assigned to perform a penetration test on the target’s wireless network infrastructure, identifying the geolocation helps the ethical hacker to identify the physical location of the target’s premises. Furthermore, videos and vlogs that are posted online contain information about the target’s environment, such as their office locations and spaces, where they’ve been, and how often they have visited <span class="No-Break">a location.</span></p>
			<p>Collecting data from documents, articles, and blogs enables an ethical hacker to identify the technologies, projects, and work that were done by the target. For instance, many people on LinkedIn post specific details about technical projects and systems they’ve implemented within their organization. Such information helps an attacker or ethical hacker to determine the type of infrastructure and security controls that exist within <span class="No-Break">the company.</span></p>
			<p>Hence, it’s important for organizations to be aware of the risk of leaking data online that can lead to a possible cyber-attack and how this data is retrieved and <a id="_idIndexMarker246"/>exploited by cyber-criminals. As an ethical hacker, the most valuable data about your target is simply data that’s directly posted by the target and others <span class="No-Break">about them.</span></p>
			<p>The following diagram <a id="_idIndexMarker247"/>shows the various sources of data when performing <span class="No-Break">OSINT operations:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer075" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.4 – OSINT data sources</p>
			<p>As shown in the preceding diagram, there are various online sources that anyone can use to collect data about a target, then analyze the collected data to provide meaning and context. Using multiple internet search engines to research the target is essential as one search engine may provide additional data as compared to another. Many organizations and people use social media to connect and share information about themselves and their company with others. Sometimes, people leak sensitive data without realizing the impact if the data is exploited. Many organizations will post technical details <a id="_idIndexMarker248"/>and technologies within the description of a job post for hiring a new employee. Some of this information contains specific details, such as the operating systems of their servers, server types and architectures, cloud computing services, and even <span class="No-Break">networking devices.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-50"><a id="_idTextAnchor049"/>The OSINT life cycle</h2>
			<p>The OSINT life cycle <a id="_idIndexMarker249"/>helps ethical hackers to better understand the various phases that are involved in collecting, analyzing, and reporting data during the reconnaissance phase of ethical hacking and <span class="No-Break">penetration testing.</span></p>
			<p>The OSINT life cycle <a id="_idIndexMarker250"/>generally consists of the <span class="No-Break">following phases:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Understanding the requirements for <span class="No-Break">information gathering</span></li>
				<li>Performing data collection <span class="No-Break">and retrieval</span></li>
				<li>Conducting data analysis of <span class="No-Break">collected data</span></li>
				<li>Pivoting and reporting <span class="No-Break">the analysis</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>The following diagram shows the continuous processes when <span class="No-Break">performing OSINT:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer076" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_3.05_B19448.jpg" alt="Figure 3.5 – OSINT life cycle"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.5 – OSINT life cycle</p>
			<p>During phase 1, <em class="italic">Requirements for Gathering Information</em>, it’s important for the ethical hacker to have a clear understanding of what the organization wants. Therefore, the following are some questions that should be asked to the client to <span class="No-Break">gain clarity:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>What are the deliverables at the end of the OSINT <span class="No-Break">penetration test?</span></li>
				<li>Is the organization interested in identifying whether their data is being <span class="No-Break">leaked online?</span></li>
				<li>How will an attacker identify the points of entry (attack surface) and security vulnerabilities within <span class="No-Break">their organization?</span></li>
				<li>What would the risk level and impact be if an attacker were to leverage OSINT to compromise the organization’s systems <span class="No-Break">and network?</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In phase 2, <em class="italic">Data Collection and Retrieval</em>, the ethical hacker uses <strong class="bold">Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures</strong> (<strong class="bold">TTPs</strong>) that are similar to that of real hackers to collect data <a id="_idIndexMarker251"/>about the target from publicly available sources. During this phase, it’s important to collect all sufficient data, such as photos, videos, documents, and other media types, from various data sources on the internet that can provide context about the targeted organization. However, it’s essential the ethical hacker identifies what data is considered to be relevant information and at what point sufficient data has <span class="No-Break">been collected.</span></p>
			<p>During phase 3, <em class="italic">Analysis of Collected Data</em>, the ethical hacker carefully analyzes the collected data to better understand how it will be applicable to meet the customer’s requirements while <a id="_idIndexMarker252"/>sorting it into both meaningful and useful categories. During this phase, the ethical hacker sometimes discovers something interesting and decides to go deeper into collecting more data. For instance, if an ethical hacker discovers the targeted organization is hiring an IT professional to manage their self-hosted servers, the ethical hacker may attempt to find additional information from current and past job posts for any technical details that may reveal the operating systems of the target’s internal servers. Diving deeper, the ethical hacker may use social media, such as LinkedIn, to collect intelligence on any IT systems that were implemented by past and current employees of <span class="No-Break">the target.</span></p>
			<p>The collected data is processed and converted into meaningful information by determining <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Is the collected <span class="No-Break">data accurate?</span></li>
				<li>Was the data collected from <span class="No-Break">credible sources?</span></li>
				<li>Is the collected data factual <span class="No-Break">or subjective?</span></li>
				<li>Is more data needed to better understand a specific area of <span class="No-Break">the target?</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In phase 4, <em class="italic">Pivoting and Reporting of Analysis</em>, the ethical hacker may pivot into collecting additional data in a different area about the target. For instance, if sufficient data is collected and <a id="_idIndexMarker253"/>analyzed about the organizational structure of the targeted organization, pivoting into collecting data about the social media presence of each employee may be beneficial in finding additional data leaks about the target. For instance, pivoting can lead to discovering the social media accounts of IT professionals of the targeted organization, and enable you to identify the technologies <a id="_idIndexMarker254"/>that are used within the company if they are <span class="No-Break">posted online.</span></p>
			<p>Once enough/sufficient data is analyzed about the target, the ethical hacker then moves into the reporting phase, which contains the relevant data, information, and the analysis that was performed. It’s important to notify the client/customer about the evidence collected during OSINT and why it should be important to them. Hence, provide awareness on how the data was leaked by employees and how it can be leveraged by real hackers to plan a possible future cyber-attack on <span class="No-Break">the company.</span></p>
			<p>When collecting data about a target, sometimes the process becomes a bit overwhelming and <a id="_idIndexMarker255"/>determining whether to pivot into another direction creates uncertainty. To help provide a clear visual map and interconnection of OSINT data, <strong class="bold">Your OSINT Graphical Analyzer</strong> (<strong class="bold">YOGA</strong>) is a free online resource that helps cybersecurity professionals to easily visualize how they can move on to another data point and collect more data during the <span class="No-Break">OSINT process.</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.6 – YOGA data points and map</p>
			<p>As shown in the preceding figure, YOGA shows how one data point is interconnected with another, which enables the ethical hacker to easily follow the map to another data point to collect additional intelligence about <span class="No-Break">the target.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>

			<p>Next, you will discover how OSINT helps law enforcement discover new criminal activities and increase awareness, and how it can be leveraged by <span class="No-Break">ethical hackers.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-51"><a id="_idTextAnchor050"/>Benefits of using OSINT</h2>
			<p>Having knowledge and understanding of how to use OSINT in the right way makes a person very <a id="_idIndexMarker258"/>powerful. Similarly, there’s a lot of publicly available data on the internet but understanding how to collect and analyze such data to create meaning and context on a topic can be used with both good and bad motives and intentions. As ethical hackers and penetration testers, we’ll focus on using OSINT with good intentions, such as helping organizations to reduce their attack surface and improve their <span class="No-Break">security posture.</span></p>
			<p>OSINT is commonly used for both good and lawful purposes. For instance, law enforcement leverages the data from OSINT to determine the location and additional details about <em class="italic">persons of interest</em> and wanted persons. A wanted person may use social media to brag about their evasion from being caught by the local law enforcement agency and make an online post showing they are having fun at a party. Law enforcement professionals can monitor their target and any posts that are made about the target to determine their location and activities. Photos and video footage that are posted on social media help law enforcement to discover new crimes. Furthermore, there are people who break the law and overshare their activities on social media, which leads to self-incrimination and helps law enforcement become aware of <span class="No-Break">unlawful acts.</span></p>
			<p>As previously mentioned, social media platforms were created to help people stay connected and share updates with each other. However, social media platforms are commonly used by law enforcement as modern-day wanted posters to help raise awareness of suspects and criminal activities with the intention of reaching a <span class="No-Break">larger audience.</span></p>
			<p>There are many missing people around the world. Using OSINT can help you and law enforcement to find missing people by leveraging the information collected from the internet about the missing person. For instance, a missing person may have a social media account that contains data about their daily life and activities, friends, and groups. The daily activities can be used to identify common patterns of the missing person and whether <a id="_idIndexMarker259"/>something unusual occurred recently. The victim’s friend list can help law enforcement determine who was able to view the victim’s activities, posts, photos, and videos prior to the incident, and whether any of these people had a motive to do something unlawful. What if a stalker was on the victim’s friend list, masking as a law-abiding citizen but secretly monitoring their daily activities and using the information to plan criminal activities? Overall, cybersecurity professionals who work with law enforcement can use OSINT to find missing people and catch <span class="No-Break">unlawful persons.</span></p>
			<p>As an ethical hacker, it’s important to conceal your identity while performing OSINT operations on a target. In the next section, you will learn about the importance of hiding your online identity when collecting information about <span class="No-Break">your target.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-52"><a id="_idTextAnchor051"/>Concealing your online identity</h1>
			<p>To better understand the importance of concealing your identity as an ethical hacker when performing OSINT, let’s imagine your organization was compromised by a threat actor who sent a <a id="_idIndexMarker260"/>phishing email message to a high-profile employee of the company who was tricked into clicking an obfuscated link that looked safe. Upon clicking the obfuscated link, malware was downloaded and executed on the victim’s system, which enabled the threat actor to gain unauthorized access and exfiltrate confidential data from the organization’s servers and other devices. Afterward, the threat actor sent an email message to the organization that indicated the type of data that was exfiltrated from the servers and requested the company send a payment of cryptocurrency within 24 hours, or else the threat actor would sell the data on the <em class="italic">dark web</em> to the <span class="No-Break">highest bidder.</span></p>
			<p>Within the organization, Bob is the security professional who manages and oversees the company’s security operations and is the go-to person for security-related concerns. The security breach was brought to Bob’s attention quickly as the leadership team was concerned about their intellectual property and other confidential data being sold on the dark web to other hackers. Bob decided to inspect the source code of the email message that was sent by the threat actor to identify any information that could be used to find the <a id="_idIndexMarker261"/>sender of the email and the location of the attacker. For instance, the origin IP address can be used to determine the geolocation and network provider of <span class="No-Break">the sender.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">Within the header of email messages, the origin IP address is sometimes unmasked, which enables the recipient to identify the real IP address of the sender. However, many email providers mask their sender’s real IP addresses on outbound messages, hence increasing the complexity of tracing an email back to its real source. However, you can attempt to social engineer the hacker by creating and sending a <strong class="bold">canary token</strong> via email to the threat actor. Canary tokens (<a href="https://canarytokens.org/generate">https://canarytokens.org/generate</a>) are used to help cybersecurity <a id="_idIndexMarker262"/>professionals determine whether their systems or networks are breached and trick an adversary into announcing themselves and revealing <span class="No-Break">their geolocation.</span></p>
			<p>However, Bob was unable to find the threat actor’s real IP address from the email header and decided to perform an online search using the sender’s name and alias that was found within the message. Performing a Google search on the threat actor’s alias may provide some results or none at all. Searching on social media websites such as LinkedIn for any profile that has the sender’s name will trigger an alert to the profile owner, therefore cybersecurity professionals need to be mindful about alerting their targets. For instance, if you use your personal account to search and view someone’s profile on LinkedIn, the target will be notified and given the identity of who viewed their profile. Imagine if Bob used his personal account to find the attacker, who may be using a fake profile on LinkedIn. Then, the threat actor will be notified that someone from the victim organization is performing an investigation for the perpetrator of the cyber-attack. To put it <a id="_idIndexMarker263"/>simply, Bob should use a different account that cannot be traced back to him or his company to prevent the target from being aware of <span class="No-Break">the investigation.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-53"><a id="_idTextAnchor052"/>Fundamentals of sock puppets</h2>
			<p>Whether you’re performing an OSINT investigation on a cyber-criminal or as an ethical hacker for an organization, it’s important to hide your real identity to avoid the target identifying who is collecting <a id="_idIndexMarker264"/>information and tracing it back to you. Hence, it’s always recommended to never use personal accounts <span class="No-Break">for work.</span></p>
			<p>Ethical hackers use a <strong class="bold">socket puppet</strong> to conceal or hide their identity when performing investigations and OSINT operations on a target. A sock puppet is one or more alternate social media accounts <a id="_idIndexMarker265"/>that are set up and operated by the ethical hacker for the purpose of performing OSINT, such as collecting intelligence from various online data sources. The concept of using a sock puppet is to be pseudo-anonymous and it should never be traced back to you, the ethical hacker. It provides privacy while <span class="No-Break">gathering intelligence.</span></p>
			<p>Furthermore, sock puppets enable ethical hackers to create multiple custom social media accounts for the purpose of collecting intelligence about the target. However, the sock puppet accounts should have a realistic persona, making it convincing to anyone that the account is real and not fake, including the target. The sock puppet account should be an online personality that will acquire followers and encourage others to connect, enabling the ethical hacker to connect with the target and gather more information. Additionally, the <a id="_idIndexMarker266"/>sock puppet excellently conforms to <strong class="bold">Operational Security</strong> (<strong class="bold">OPSEC</strong>) practices as the account does not trace back to you. Remember, when you’re performing OSINT operations or investigating a target, it’s important that the target is unaware you are investigating or collecting intelligence <span class="No-Break">about them.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-54"><a id="_idTextAnchor053"/>Setting up a sock puppet</h2>
			<p>Before setting up a sock puppet, it’s important the ethical hacker determines whether anonymity and/or persistence is required. If anonymity is required, this implies you do not want the target to <a id="_idIndexMarker267"/>find or trace who you are while performing intelligence gathering on them. To ensure anonymity, you will be required to carry out a lot more work when setting up a sock puppet. If persistence is required on the sock puppet, this means the ethical hacker wants to ensure the fake persona will interact with others on social media, following and connecting with others, and frequently posting new statuses and updates regularly to ensure the sock puppet has a real persona and is not identified as a fake account. Persistence also means the ethical hacker will need to infiltrate social networks, such as groups, for weeks, months, or years to build a trusted online presence. However, if you’re not looking for persistence, then the sock puppet <a id="_idIndexMarker268"/>will be easier to set up and maintain compared to a <span class="No-Break">persistent account.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">Never use personal accounts for work-related activities, such as OSINT operations, investigations, ethical hacking, or <span class="No-Break">penetration testing.</span></p>
			<p>The following are guidelines and recommendations for creating a <span class="No-Break">sock puppet:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>When creating a <a id="_idIndexMarker269"/>sock puppet, your origin details are important. Do not use your own IP address when creating and setting up a social media account. Consider visiting a local coffee shop with free <span class="No-Break">wireless internet.</span></li>
				<li>Do not use <strong class="bold">Virtual Private Network</strong> (<strong class="bold">VPN</strong>) or TOR services as social media platforms <a id="_idIndexMarker270"/>can detect when origin traffic is being sent through a proxy or VPN and will require you to further validate <span class="No-Break">your identity.</span></li>
				<li>Ensure your online appearance on social media looks like a normal, regular person to avoid being flagged as a fake <span class="No-Break">user account.</span></li>
				<li>Use a <em class="italic">burner</em> email address when signing up for a social media account. Consider using <strong class="bold">Proton Mail</strong> (<a href="https://proton.me/">https://proton.me/</a>) as it provides additional privacy and <a id="_idIndexMarker271"/>data encryption. However, you can also use a typical email service, such as Gmail, Yahoo Mail, or Hotmail. Ensure the email address is very <span class="No-Break">vanilla (basic).</span></li>
				<li>When using Facebook, use the mobile version of the website (<a href="https://m.facebook.com/">https://m.facebook.com/</a>) as it performs fewer security checks and validations as compared to the desktop version of <span class="No-Break">the website.</span></li>
				<li>Ensure you share content regularly, such as status updates, photos, and videos, and interact and connect with people on the social <span class="No-Break">media platform.</span></li>
				<li>Do not use someone else’s pictures. It’s very easy to perform a reverse image search to determine whether a picture is fake <span class="No-Break">or not.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The following <a id="_idIndexMarker272"/>are useful resources when creating a <span class="No-Break">sock puppet:</span></p>
			<ul>

			</ul>
			<p><strong class="bold">Fake Name Generator</strong> enables an ethical hacker to quickly generate a fake identity that can be used when <a id="_idIndexMarker273"/>creating a sock puppet. The website allows you to customize the identity, such as gender, name set, and country, to create a believable <a id="_idIndexMarker274"/>persona. <strong class="bold">This Person Does Not Exist </strong>is a website that uses <strong class="bold">Artificial Intelligence</strong> (<strong class="bold">AI</strong>) to create fake pictures of people who do<a id="_idIndexMarker275"/> not actually exist. <strong class="bold">Privacy Cards</strong> is a website that enables <a id="_idIndexMarker276"/>you to create a proxy for your real credit card such that you do not need to insert your real credit card details on an e-commerce website when making purchases; a proxy credit card is created that can be used instead. Therefore, the e-commerce <a id="_idIndexMarker277"/>merchant will not know your real credit card number and details. <strong class="bold">WEBGAP</strong> provides remote browser isolation services that enable anyone to browse the internet using a remote browser for additional security <span class="No-Break">and privacy.</span></p>
			<p>The following are additional resources that may be needed based on the <span class="No-Break">OSINT operations:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>A <em class="italic">burner</em> telephone <a id="_idIndexMarker278"/>number from a service provider who does not recycle the numbers each month. This <em class="italic">burner</em> telephone number can <a id="_idIndexMarker279"/>be used for account <span class="No-Break">verification purposes.</span></li>
				<li>A proxy credit card can be used to purchase the burner phone and additional items <span class="No-Break">if needed.</span></li>
				<li>Virtual machines for performing OSINT operations <span class="No-Break">and investigations.</span></li>
				<li>A VPN service <span class="No-Break">if needed.</span></li>
				<li>Always use a dedicated computer when performing OSINT operations as you do not want the target <a id="_idIndexMarker280"/>to trace anything back to you. Consider inexpensive microcomputers, such as <span class="No-Break">Raspberry Pi.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Having completed this section, you have learned the importance and how to get started with using a sock puppet to hide your online identity when performing OSINT operations on a target. Next, you will learn how to anonymize your <span class="No-Break">internet traffic.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-55"><a id="_idTextAnchor054"/>Anonymizing your network traffic</h1>
			<p>As an ethical hacker who is performing OSINT operations, it’s important to ensure the target is not able to trace who is collecting data about them. Skilled cybersecurity and network professionals are able to capture and analyze the data found within network packets and logs to determine the source of the traffic; hence, it’s recommended to anonymize your <a id="_idIndexMarker281"/>network traffic while using the internet to mask your real geolocation and source public <span class="No-Break">IP address.</span></p>
			<p>The following <a id="_idIndexMarker282"/>are common techniques that are used to anonymize <span class="No-Break">internet-based traffic:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">VPNs</strong></span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">ProxyChains</strong></span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">TOR</strong></span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The following sub-sections will describe the advantages and how each of the preceding technologies works to anonymize your <span class="No-Break">internet-based traffic.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-56"><a id="_idTextAnchor055"/>VPNs</h2>
			<p>A VPN enables a <a id="_idIndexMarker283"/>user to establish a secure communication channel <a id="_idIndexMarker284"/>over an unsecure network, thus providing confidentiality and mitigating eavesdropping attacks over a network. VPNs are commonly used by organizations to establish secure and remote connectivity between their remote offices and the main office <a id="_idIndexMarker285"/>without requiring a managed <strong class="bold">Wide Area Network</strong> (<strong class="bold">WAN</strong>) from a telecommunication service provider. These are commonly referred to as <strong class="bold">site-to-site VPNs</strong>. There are also <strong class="bold">remote access VPNs</strong>, which are implemented <a id="_idIndexMarker286"/>by organizations to enable their remote workers to securely connect <a id="_idIndexMarker287"/>and access resources on the <span class="No-Break">corporate network.</span></p>
			<p>Ethical hackers can either set up their own remote access VPN server on the cloud or subscribe to a commercial VPN provider. Setting your own remote access VPN on the cloud requires some technical skills, such as knowing how to set up a virtual machine on your preferred <a id="_idIndexMarker288"/>cloud service provider environment and some networking skills. The advantage of owning the VPN server is that no one else sees your VPN traffic logs but you, hence, there’s added privacy. However, it’s very important that you secure the operating system of your server on the cloud to prevent threat actors from gaining <a id="_idIndexMarker289"/>unauthorized access to it. Additionally, when setting up your virtual machine on the cloud, you’ll need to select a hosting location. This location will be the exit point for all traffic that uses your VPN channel. Therefore, if you’re located in the <strong class="bold">United States</strong> (<strong class="bold">US</strong>) and your VPN server is hosted in the <strong class="bold">United Kingdom</strong> (<strong class="bold">UK</strong>), then all your internet-based traffic that’s routed through your VPN will exit in the UK and the source public IP address will be shown as a <span class="No-Break">UK-based address.</span></p>
			<p>The following diagram shows the concept of using a VPN to anonymize <span class="No-Break">your traffic:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer078" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_3.07_B19448.jpg" alt="Figure 3.7 – VPN concept"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.7 – VPN concept</p>
			<p>As shown in the preceding diagram, the attacker machine is being used by the ethical hacker while it connects to the VPN server on the cloud. All internet-based traffic is sent through the VPN tunnel and exits at the hosting location (country) before it’s sent to the target. Therefore, if the target captures and analyzes the network packets, it’ll be traced back to the exit node (the VPN server) and not to the ethical <span class="No-Break">hacker’s machine.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
			<p class="callout"><strong class="bold">OpenVPN</strong> provides a self-hosted <a id="_idIndexMarker290"/>Access Server option that enables you to connect up to <a id="_idIndexMarker291"/>two devices for free. This enables you to set up your own OpenVPN Access Server on your own device or on the cloud. Please refer to the following link to learn <span class="No-Break">more: </span><a href="https://openvpn.net/access-server/"><span class="No-Break">https://openvpn.net/access-server/</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>Some ethical hackers will prefer to use a commercial VPN service provider, which reduces the need for configuring and setting up a virtual server on the cloud. One of the major benefits of using a <a id="_idIndexMarker292"/>subscription-based VPN service is that it enables the <a id="_idIndexMarker293"/>subscriber to connect to multiple VPN servers around the world in various countries that are all managed by the same commercial VPN provider. Therefore, you can easily switch between different countries and choose the location of the exit-node that will be routing your traffic to <span class="No-Break">the Internet.</span></p>
			<p>The following are <a id="_idIndexMarker294"/>general considerations for <span class="No-Break">using VPNs:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Whether you’re hosting a VPN server on the cloud or using a commercial VPN service, there’s a cost that’s attached <span class="No-Break">to it.</span></li>
				<li>Ensure your preferred VPN service provider does not keep logs about <span class="No-Break">your traffic.</span></li>
				<li>Ensure your preferred VPN service provider does not sell <span class="No-Break">your data.</span></li>
				<li>Ensure your preferred VPN service provider has unmetered <span class="No-Break">bandwidth usage.</span></li>
				<li>Ensure the VPN client is supported by your computer’s host <span class="No-Break">operating system.</span></li>
				<li>Many cloud providers, such as Microsoft Azure and Amazon AWS, have a preconfigured OpenVPN Access Server available for <span class="No-Break">quick deployment.</span></li>
				<li>When using a VPN, ensure your DNS traffic is not leaked outside the VPN, or else your real <a id="_idIndexMarker295"/>geolocation will be revealed. Consider testing your DNS leakage by using <strong class="bold">DNS leak test</strong> <span class="No-Break">at </span><a href="https://www.dnsleaktest.com/"><span class="No-Break">https://www.dnsleaktest.com/</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
				<li>If your VPN service <a id="_idIndexMarker296"/>does not support IPv6, ensure IPv6 is disabled on your machine to prevent leakage of <span class="No-Break">your geolocation.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>While there are many commercial VPN service providers, the list of the top VPN service providers changes <a id="_idIndexMarker297"/>from time to time based on their services, features, <a id="_idIndexMarker298"/>performance, and reviews. Take some time to research which commercial VPN provider is most suitable for your needs or whether a self-hosted solution is better. Next, you will learn about Proxychains and how to set <span class="No-Break">it up.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-57"><a id="_idTextAnchor056"/>Proxychains</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Proxychains</strong> is a common technique and tool used by ethical hackers to mask the origin of their <a id="_idIndexMarker299"/>network traffic while increasing privacy and security. Proxychains enables <a id="_idIndexMarker300"/>network traffic to be routed through multiple proxy servers on the internet, creating a chaining effect, and is useful when more than one proxy server is used to improve the desired level of anonymity <span class="No-Break">and security.</span></p>
			<p>The following are the advantages of using proxy servers and Proxychains for <span class="No-Break">OSINT operations:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Providing anonymity</strong>: Proxychains simply allows your internet-based traffic to be routed through more <a id="_idIndexMarker301"/>than one proxy server. This enables an ethical hacker to hide their real source IP address and identity during <span class="No-Break">OSINT operations.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Bypassing geo-restrictions</strong>: There are many networks and organizations that restrict access to specific websites and services. Using proxy chaining enables ethical hackers to bypass these geolocations and gain access to <span class="No-Break">the target.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Circumventing security measures</strong>: There are security systems that are implemented by organizations that are designed to detect and prevent malicious traffic based on their source address and geolocation. Using proxy chaining enables an ethical hacker to make it more difficult for these security systems to detect and restrict <span class="No-Break">their traffic.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Proxychains tool enables an ethical hacker to configure a list of proxy servers that will be used to route network traffic through them in a chain-like format. This is commonly <a id="_idIndexMarker302"/>referred to as <strong class="bold">proxy chaining</strong>. When the ethical hacker sends traffic to a target, the <a id="_idIndexMarker303"/>packets pass through the first proxy server in the chain, then <a id="_idIndexMarker304"/>onto another until the packet reaches the target. When the target responds, the returning packets travel in reverse order through the chain of proxy servers back to the ethical <span class="No-Break">hacker’s machine.</span></p>
			<p>The following diagram shows the chaining of <span class="No-Break">proxy servers:</span></p>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.8 – Proxy chaining</p>
			<p>Each proxy server within the chain of proxies operates as a relay, which then forwards the packet onto the next proxy server within the list until it arrives at the target. This technique enables <a id="_idIndexMarker305"/>an ethical hacker to hide their identity, their real public IP address, and their location. The target will see the exit node or the last proxy server from the chain of proxies as the origin of <span class="No-Break">the traffic.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">There are many websites on the internet that provide a list of free proxy servers. Consider checking <span class="No-Break">out </span><a href="https://spys.one/en/"><span class="No-Break">https://spys.one/en/</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">proxychains4.conf</strong> file on Kali Linux enables you to configure the Proxychains tool and add specific servers to <a id="_idIndexMarker306"/>the list of preferred proxy servers to create the proxy chaining effect. Additionally, Proxychains supports the following types of <span class="No-Break">proxy servers:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break">HTTP</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">HTTPS</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">SOCKS4</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">SOCKS5</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Each of these specific types of proxy servers has its own set of security features. Proxy servers that use HTTP to relay and forward traffic do not provide data encryption, while proxy servers that <a id="_idIndexMarker307"/>use HTTPS will encrypt the traffic. It is important to conduct additional research on the type of proxy servers that are the best fit for your needs prior to your OSINT operation on <span class="No-Break">a target.</span></p>
			<p>To get <a id="_idIndexMarker308"/>started setting up Proxychains, please use the <span class="No-Break">following instructions:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Open VirtualBox Manager and power on the Kali Linux <span class="No-Break">virtual machine.</span></li>

			<p>Next, you will learn how to anonymize your internet-based traffic through the dark web <span class="No-Break">using TOR.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-58"><a id="_idTextAnchor057"/>TOR</h2>
			<p>TOR is an open source project that enables anyone to anonymously browse the internet. The TOR network routes a user’s internet-based traffic through multiple nodes, which enables the user to <a id="_idIndexMarker314"/>hide their identity and geolocation while using the internet. This is <a id="_idIndexMarker315"/>very useful for ethical hackers. When a user sends traffic through the TOR network, it will encrypt the network traffic and wrap it in multiple layers of encryption. As the encrypted traffic is passed onto another node, the receiving node will remove a layer of encryption to reveal the next node to forward the traffic toward, and this process is repeated until the traffic arrives at the target. At this point, the target receives the encrypted data and will not be able to trace the real origin of the packets back to <span class="No-Break">the sender.</span></p>
			<p>The following diagram shows the general concept of <span class="No-Break">using TOR:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer085" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_3.14_B19448.jpg" alt="Figure 3.14 – Routing using TOR"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.14 – Routing using TOR</p>
			<p>Within the TOR network, each node only knows the previous and the next node to create a chaining effect similar to proxy chaining. However, the nodes do not know the sender (source) or the final destination (target) of the traffic. This creates a lot of complexity for any node within the TOR network or anyone to determine the real origin and destination of the <a id="_idIndexMarker316"/>traffic that’s routed over the TOR network. As an <a id="_idIndexMarker317"/>additional layer of security, the traffic is encrypted, decrypted, and re-encrypted multiple times to prevent anyone who is intercepting the traffic to identify the original data or the source of the traffic. Using TOR enables users to browse the internet and access dark web websites that use the <strong class="source-inline">.</strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">onion</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> domain.</span></p>
			<p>The following is the process of what happens when you connect to the <span class="No-Break">TOR network:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>The ethical hacker will connect to TOR and open the <span class="No-Break">TOR Browser.</span></li>
				<li>The TOR browser will encrypt the outbound traffic to the first relay node within the <span class="No-Break">TOR network.</span></li>
				<li>The first node will receive the traffic, decrypt the first layer of encryption to determine the next node, and forward the traffic to the <span class="No-Break">next node.</span></li>
				<li>This process is repeated along the way as each node will decrypt one layer of encryption on the traffic, then forward the traffic to the next until it reaches the final (exit) node on the <span class="No-Break">TOR network.</span></li>
				<li>The final or exit <a id="_idIndexMarker318"/>node in TOR will forward the request to <span class="No-Break">the target.</span></li>
				<li>When the target responds, the returning traffic is sent back through the TOR network using the same path in reverse order. Each node will encrypt the traffic before forwarding it to the next. This process is repeated until it arrives at the final (exit) node in <span class="No-Break">reverse order.</span></li>
				<li>The final (exit) node <a id="_idIndexMarker319"/>will forward the encrypted traffic back to your TOR browser, which will decrypt and display the returning data from <span class="No-Break">the target.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>To get started setting up TOR and the TOR browser, please use the <span class="No-Break">following instructions:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Open VirtualBox <a id="_idIndexMarker320"/>Manager and power on the Kali Linux <span class="No-Break">virtual machine.</span></li>
