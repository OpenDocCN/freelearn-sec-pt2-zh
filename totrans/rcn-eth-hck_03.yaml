    world, the internet is becoming a massive storage medium. Lots of people are uploading
    various types of data on many websites and online platforms. While the internet
    is known as the *information super-highway*, enabling people around the world
    to share information and collaborate, it has become a medium for storing data
    about people, organizations, systems, and networks. Such information can be leveraged
    by adversaries with malicious intent to plan future cyber-attacks on a target.
    As an aspiring ethical hacker, it’s important to understand how adversaries are
    able to discover and leverage publicly available information to create a profile
    of their target and improve their strategies and techniques in their cyber operations.

    to many people and organizations, helping everyone to collaborate and share ideas
    with others beyond traditional borders. The internet was originally referred to
    as an information super-highway, enabling a user with an internet connection and
    a computer to easily visit websites, participate in online forums and communities,
    and perform e-commerce transactions without visiting a traditional *brick-and-mortar*

    any organization that’s hiring professionals within your region. Using the web
    browser on your smartphone and Google Search, you can quickly research the top
    cybersecurity organizations within your region, check their career portal, and
    explore their hiring process. Additionally, you can further determine the mission,
    vision, core values, interviewing process and panel, and job responsibilities
    and requirements of a suitable candidate. However, some organizations leak too

    audio, video, and other file types. This data is not automatically erased from
    the internet when a user decides to delete it. For instance, the **Internet Archive**
    is a public digital library that indexes and keeps a record of everything it knows
    on the internet for the past 20 years. To put it simply, if you upload or create
    anything on the internet and delete it after, it’s not erased from the internet
    because it can be retrieved using the **Wayback Machine** on the Internet Archive
    to view historical data on the internet. Hence, threat actors leverage data collected

    and governments are becoming more aware of the impact of confidential data being
    available to anyone with malicious intentions, such as adversaries and other threat
    actors. There are many data privacy concerns when visiting websites, such as whether
    users’ data is being collected and how it’s going to be used by the website owner.
    For instance, some websites do not have any security protection for their users
    and will transmit data between the web server and the user’s web browser in plaintext,
    enabling an adversary to intercept and capture any sensitive data. For instance,
    websites insert cookies into the visitor’s web browser, which enables the website
    to track the visitor’s activities and information about the user while improving
    the user experience. If a threat actor were to capture and analyze the data found
    within cookies, the adversary will be able to retrieve **session IDs** and determine
    the user’s web activities. If the user is authenticated on the website, the session
    ID enables the threat actor to gain unauthorized access to the victim’s account
    on the same website without knowing the victim’s user credentials.

    people to digitally connect and share updates with their family, friends, and
    co-workers using an online digital platform. Social media platforms have grown
    a lot over the past decade as many people and organizations use these platforms
    to start online communities, advertise their products and services, and share
    news and updates. While social media websites encourage everyone to connect with
    each other, it’s important to understand these websites create a **web of people**
    who are linked to each other with a mutual connection. For instance, when you
    visit someone’s profile on a social media platform as a logged-in user, the platform
    shows your mutual connections or friends. If you click on a mutual contact, you’re
    redirected to the person’s profile where you may see additional mutual connections
    or friends, which creates a digital web of people who are interconnected in some
    way.

    pictures that are posted by your family, friends, or co-workers with less secure
    profile. This provides the opportunity for a threat actor to use facial recognition
    to determine the identity of a person from a picture and use Google Images to
    perform **reverse image searches** to identify any websites that contain similar
    pictures to determine the identity or location of someone or something.

    to research and identify whether the operating system is vulnerable and can be
    exploited. Within many organizations, there are outdated and vulnerable applications
    and services that are running on hosts, which creates the opportunity for an ethical
    hacker to identify and exploit security vulnerabilities on running services to

    vulnerable network protocols and services running between systems on the network.
    Many common network protocols were not designed with security in mind, thus enabling
    threat actors to exploit their security weaknesses to perform cyber-attacks. An
    attacker can intercept and identify sensitive network information, such as **Domain
    Name System** (**DNS**), **Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution** (**LLMNR**),
    **Address Resolution Protocol** (**ARP**), domain names, sub-domain names, and
    firewall rules. For instance, if a threat actor were to capture DNS queries and
    replies, the attacker may be able to identify the organization’s DNS servers and

    the internet. While many people post and upload various types of data every day
    on the internet, ethical hackers can leverage the data on the internet to create
    a profile and better understand their target. While OSINT may seem to be as simple
    as using a search engine such as Google Search to find answers to questions, many
    people typically use the information and resources that are displayed on page
    1 of the search results as it’s generally the most related to the search criteria.
    However, not many people will check the remaining pages of the search results,
    such as pages 2–10, to determine whether the answers to the search criteria are
    accurate and provide comprehensive details to the user.

    does not always provide meaning and context and needs to be thoroughly analyzed
    to create meaning, enabling ethical hackers to better understand the system details
    and network and organizational information about the target. Hence, it’s essential,
    when using internet search engines to find data, to go beyond page 1 to collect
    more data about the target. The idea is to collect everything, then analyze the
    collected data to create meaning and provide context as it relates to the target.

    by others about the target and they contain useful data to better understand and
    profile the target. For instance, if a target posts photos about their vacation
    on social media, an ethical hacker can observe the details of the pictures, such
    as the date posted and background. The date helps the ethical hacker to determine
    when and how often the target visited the location, specific times when the target
    took a vacation, and whether there are any other patterns that can be leveraged
    to track the target’s movement. Furthermore, the background within each photo
    reveals identifying information about the physical location of where the photo
    was taken and enables the ethical hacker to use online search engines, such as
    Google Images, to perform a reverse image lookup to determine the geolocation
    of the target.

    on the target’s wireless network infrastructure, identifying the geolocation helps
    the ethical hacker to identify the physical location of the target’s premises.

    the target’s environment, such as their office locations and spaces, where they’ve
    been, and how often they have visited a location.

    is essential as one search engine may provide additional data as compared to another.
    Many organizations and people use social media to connect and share information
    about themselves and their company with others. Sometimes, people leak sensitive
    data without realizing the impact if the data is exploited. Many organizations
    will post technical details and technologies within the description of a job post
    for hiring a new employee. Some of this information contains specific details,
    such as the operating systems of their servers, server types and architectures,
    cloud computing services, and even networking devices.

    Techniques, and Procedures** (**TTPs**) that are similar to that of real hackers
    to collect data about the target from publicly available sources. During this
    phase, it’s important to collect all sufficient data, such as photos, videos,
    documents, and other media types, from various data sources on the internet that
    can provide context about the targeted organization. However, it’s essential the
    ethical hacker identifies what data is considered to be relevant information and
    at what point sufficient data has been collected.

    the collected data to better understand how it will be applicable to meet the
    customer’s requirements while sorting it into both meaningful and useful categories.
    During this phase, the ethical hacker sometimes discovers something interesting
    and decides to go deeper into collecting more data. For instance, if an ethical
    hacker discovers the targeted organization is hiring an IT professional to manage
    their self-hosted servers, the ethical hacker may attempt to find additional information
    from current and past job posts for any technical details that may reveal the
    operating systems of the target’s internal servers. Diving deeper, the ethical
    hacker may use social media, such as LinkedIn, to collect intelligence on any
    IT systems that were implemented by past and current employees of the target.

    of the targeted organization, pivoting into collecting data about the social media
    presence of each employee may be beneficial in finding additional data leaks about
    the target. For instance, pivoting can lead to discovering the social media accounts
    of IT professionals of the targeted organization, and enable you to identify the
    technologies that are used within the company if they are posted online.

    friends, and groups. The daily activities can be used to identify common patterns
    of the missing person and whether something unusual occurred recently. The victim’s
    friend list can help law enforcement determine who was able to view the victim’s
    activities, posts, photos, and videos prior to the incident, and whether any of
    these people had a motive to do something unlawful. What if a stalker was on the
    victim’s friend list, masking as a law-abiding citizen but secretly monitoring

    of the company who was tricked into clicking an obfuscated link that looked safe.
    Upon clicking the obfuscated link, malware was downloaded and executed on the
    victim’s system, which enabled the threat actor to gain unauthorized access and
    exfiltrate confidential data from the organization’s servers and other devices.
    Afterward, the threat actor sent an email message to the organization that indicated
    the type of data that was exfiltrated from the servers and requested the company

    team was concerned about their intellectual property and other confidential data
    being sold on the dark web to other hackers. Bob decided to inspect the source
    code of the email message that was sent by the threat actor to identify any information
    that could be used to find the sender of the email and the location of the attacker.
    For instance, the origin IP address can be used to determine the geolocation and

    which enables the recipient to identify the real IP address of the sender. However,
    many email providers mask their sender’s real IP addresses on outbound messages,
    hence increasing the complexity of tracing an email back to its real source. However,
    you can attempt to social engineer the hacker by creating and sending a **canary
    token** via email to the threat actor. Canary tokens ([https://canarytokens.org/generate](https://canarytokens.org/generate))
    are used to help cybersecurity professionals determine whether their systems or
    networks are breached and trick an adversary into announcing themselves and revealing
    their geolocation.

    email header and decided to perform an online search using the sender’s name and
    alias that was found within the message. Performing a Google search on the threat
    actor’s alias may provide some results or none at all. Searching on social media
    websites such as LinkedIn for any profile that has the sender’s name will trigger
    an alert to the profile owner, therefore cybersecurity professionals need to be
    mindful about alerting their targets. For instance, if you use your personal account
    to search and view someone’s profile on LinkedIn, the target will be notified
    and given the identity of who viewed their profile. Imagine if Bob used his personal
    account to find the attacker, who may be using a fake profile on LinkedIn. Then,
    the threat actor will be notified that someone from the victim organization is
    performing an investigation for the perpetrator of the cyber-attack. To put it
    simply, Bob should use a different account that cannot be traced back to him or
    his company to prevent the target from being aware of the investigation.

    performing investigations and OSINT operations on a target. A sock puppet is one
    or more alternate social media accounts that are set up and operated by the ethical
    hacker for the purpose of performing OSINT, such as collecting intelligence from
    various online data sources. The concept of using a sock puppet is to be pseudo-anonymous
    and it should never be traced back to you, the ethical hacker. It provides privacy
    while gathering intelligence.
  prefs: []

    media accounts for the purpose of collecting intelligence about the target. However,
    the sock puppet accounts should have a realistic persona, making it convincing
    to anyone that the account is real and not fake, including the target. The sock
    puppet account should be an online personality that will acquire followers and
    encourage others to connect, enabling the ethical hacker to connect with the target
    and gather more information. Additionally, the sock puppet excellently conforms
    to **Operational Security** (**OPSEC**) practices as the account does not trace
    back to you. Remember, when you’re performing OSINT operations or investigating
    a target, it’s important that the target is unaware you are investigating or collecting
    intelligence about them.

    whether anonymity and/or persistence is required. If anonymity is required, this
    implies you do not want the target to find or trace who you are while performing
    intelligence gathering on them. To ensure anonymity, you will be required to carry
    out a lot more work when setting up a sock puppet. If persistence is required
    on the sock puppet, this means the ethical hacker wants to ensure the fake persona
    will interact with others on social media, following and connecting with others,
    and frequently posting new statuses and updates regularly to ensure the sock puppet
    has a real persona and is not identified as a fake account. Persistence also means
    the ethical hacker will need to infiltrate social networks, such as groups, for
    weeks, months, or years to build a trusted online presence. However, if you’re
    not looking for persistence, then the sock puppet will be easier to set up and
    maintain compared to a persistent account.

    connectivity between their remote offices and the main office without requiring
    a managed **Wide Area Network** (**WAN**) from a telecommunication service provider.
    These are commonly referred to as **site-to-site VPNs**. There are also **remote

    VPN on the cloud requires some technical skills, such as knowing how to set up
    a virtual machine on your preferred cloud service provider environment and some
    networking skills. The advantage of owning the VPN server is that no one else
    sees your VPN traffic logs but you, hence, there’s added privacy. However, it’s
    very important that you secure the operating system of your server on the cloud
    to prevent threat actors from gaining unauthorized access to it. Additionally,
    when setting up your virtual machine on the cloud, you’ll need to select a hosting
    location. This location will be the exit point for all traffic that uses your
    VPN channel. Therefore, if you’re located in the **United States** (**US**) and
    your VPN server is hosted in the **United Kingdom** (**UK**), then all your internet-based
    traffic that’s routed through your VPN will exit in the UK and the source public
    IP address will be shown as a UK-based address.

    servers that will be used to route network traffic through them in a chain-like
    format. This is commonly referred to as **proxy chaining**. When the ethical hacker
    sends traffic to a target, the packets pass through the first proxy server in
    the chain, then onto another until the packet reaches the target. When the target
    responds, the returning packets travel in reverse order through the chain of proxy
    servers back to the ethical hacker’s machine.

    internet. The TOR network routes a user’s internet-based traffic through multiple
    nodes, which enables the user to hide their identity and geolocation while using
    the internet. This is very useful for ethical hackers. When a user sends traffic
    through the TOR network, it will encrypt the network traffic and wrap it in multiple
    layers of encryption. As the encrypted traffic is passed onto another node, the
    receiving node will remove a layer of encryption to reveal the next node to forward
    the traffic toward, and this process is repeated until the traffic arrives at
    the target. At this point, the target receives the encrypted data and will not
    be able to trace the real origin of the packets back to the sender.

    to create a chaining effect similar to proxy chaining. However, the nodes do not
    know the sender (source) or the final destination (target) of the traffic. This
    creates a lot of complexity for any node within the TOR network or anyone to determine
    the real origin and destination of the traffic that’s routed over the TOR network.
    As an additional layer of security, the traffic is encrypted, decrypted, and re-encrypted
    multiple times to prevent anyone who is intercepting the traffic to identify the
    original data or the source of the traffic. Using TOR enables users to browse
    the internet and access dark web websites that use the **.****onion** domain.
