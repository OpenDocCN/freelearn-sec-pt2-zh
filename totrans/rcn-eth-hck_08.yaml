- en: The race between cybersecurity professionals and threat actors is a never-ending
    marathon as hackers are always developing new techniques to discover and exploit
    security weaknesses in their targets’ systems, and security teams are working
    continuously to find hidden vulnerabilities and implement countermeasures to protect
    their assets before a real cyber-attack occurs. While software and product vendors
    frequently push security updates and patches to their applications, there’s no
    one system that’s fully secure from threats and attacks. Hence, it’s important
    that organizations perform regular ethical hacking and penetration testing assessments
    on their systems and networks to find any hidden security flaws and determine
    whether their security controls are effective in preventing real attacks and threats.

- en: A **vulnerability** is a security weakness that exists on a system that can
    be exploited by anyone, such as a threat actor, to compromise the confidentiality,
    integrity, and/or availability of the targeted system. Ethical hackers and penetration
    testers are usually hired by organizations to simulate real-world cyber-attacks
    on their systems and networks to identify hidden security flaws that are not easily
    found by the company’s internal IT team. Ethical hackers commonly use the same
    **Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures** (**TTPs**) as real adversaries to efficiently
    find hidden security weaknesses. By identifying security vulnerabilities within
    an organization, the security team can better understand how a real attacker can
    gain unauthorized access to their networks. In addition, the organization can
    improve their threat detection, implement countermeasures to prevent threats,
    and improve their incident response plan.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    If an organization installs new devices on their network without keeping track
    of this system, there’s the likelihood the IT team may not be managing or monitoring
    the device for security vulnerabilities, and this creates a risk of a cyber-attack.
    Additionally, a baseline of normal operations should be created on all critical
    assets, such as switches, routers, servers, and firewalls. A baseline is used
    to measure what is considered to be normal and abnormal behavior of a system or
    network.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: During this phase, it’s important to gain a solid understanding of the organization
    and its business processes. Sometimes an organization’s business processes may
    be creating a security risk and increase the chance a hacker is able to compromise
    the company’s systems and network. Identifying security vulnerabilities within
    business processes can help the leadership team to better understand the risk
    of doing specific actions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition, the pre-assessment phase helps the ethical hacker to determine
    what and whether there are any security controls in place to prevent potential
    attacks and threats from hackers. Such information is useful in better understanding
    the attack surface, security posture, and cyber defenses of the company. During
    this phase, it’s important to identify whether the organization has implemented
    any regulatory standards and frameworks in their operating industry and whether
    these frameworks are enforced.

- en: The vulnerability assessment phase focuses on performing different types of
    automated and manual testing on targeted systems within the scope to identify
    security weaknesses and determine their severity and impact if they are compromised.
    In addition, it’s important for ethical hackers to check each vulnerability to
    determine whether it’s a false positive or false negative during an automated
    scan.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: False positives are simply alerts on a vulnerability scanner that indicate a
    vulnerability is present on a system but does not actually exist after manual
    testing is done. A false negative is when the vulnerability scanner does not detect
    a known or hidden vulnerability on a target, but a security vulnerability was
    found after manual testing. Hence, it’s important to validate the authenticity
    of each security vulnerability on a system with manual testing. Lastly, during
    each vulnerability assessment, the ethical hacker will collect sufficient data
    that will be used for analysis and reporting.
  prefs: []

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: During the post-assessment phase, the ethical hacker uses the information collected
    during the vulnerability assessment phase to perform a risk assessment on the
    assets and organization and categorize each risk based on their severity level
    and impact on the organization. In addition, the analyzed data is used to determine
    the threat level of the organization and the risk of being compromised by a real
    threat actor.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The ethical hacker also provides recommendations on how to mitigate each risk
    by implementing countermeasures and security controls in the organization. It’s
    important to consider giving priority to high-severity risks and allocating resources
    to resolve them quickly, as these vulnerabilities usually have a higher impact
    than others.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When a security vulnerability is found, it’s good practice to perform a **root
    cause analysis** to determine the root causes of the security risk and vulnerability
    on the target. This process usually helps ethical hackers to better identify the
    appropriate solutions to prevent this problem from re-occurring in the future.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Based on the recommendations, the internal security or IT team of the organization
    should implement any fixes, updates and patches, and security controls to prevent
    a real attack from occurring and improve the security posture. Furthermore, it’s
    essential to keep a record of all the lessons learned during each vulnerability
    assessment as it can be useful in the future.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lastly, continuous monitoring and verification are required to determine whether
    the recommendations are enforced and effective in preventing future cyber-attacks
    and threats from adversaries. This means regular vulnerability scanning and monitoring
    of logs using security solutions such as **Intrusion Detection Systems** (**IDSs**),
    **Intrusion Prevention Systems** (**IPSs**), and **Security Information and Event**
    **Management** (**SIEM**).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let’s not forget, the ethical hacker will analyze all the collected data during
    the vulnerability assessment to generate both an executive and technical report
    for the organization. The executive report focuses on the high-level overview
    of the assessment and it’s presented to the executive or leadership team of the
    company, who are usually non-technical employees. Therefore, the executive report
    should not contain any jargon or too many technical terms that are confusing to
    non-technical staff members. The technical report contains the specifics about
    the vulnerability assessment, such as the tools and techniques that were used
    to identify and test the validity of each vulnerability.
