			<h1 id="_idParaDest-45"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor050"/>Chapter 3</em>: Setting Up the Environment</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we are covering the setup of the test environment that will be used in the core of the practical part, while also defining the main approach behind the practical section of this book. The main tools used will also be introduced; we'll describe their ability to perform our SQL injection tests, which will help us understand the subject matter even more.</p>
			<p>After introducing the main methodology and tools, we will also show how to configure the lab settings that will be used. In order to best configure both the client, from which we will be conducting our test attacks, and the server side, made up of virtual targets we are conducting our tests against, this chapter serves as a step-by-step guide for configuration. Luckily, we have selected tools that are, for the most part, ready to use, and the setup is relatively simple.</p>
			<p>As the client part will be mostly the same both for web application attacks and emulated devices, the first step will be configuring this machine.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, the following topics will be covered:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Understanding the practical approach and introducing the main tools</strong>: An introductory description of our approach, which will guide us throughout the practical part of this book. Think of this as an introduction to the practical section, describing the lab we will be using and the overall setting.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Overview of the Open Web Application Security (OWASP) Broken Web Application (BWA) project</strong>: For our lab setup, we will be using a freely available <strong class="bold">virtual machine</strong> (<strong class="bold">VM</strong>), provided by OWASP, containing many vulnerable web applications. This allows us to test for vulnerabilities without attacking actual websites or entities belonging to third parties.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">The attacker – configuring your client machine</strong>: Before setting our targets for our lab, in this section, we are providing our recommendation for the machine that we will be using as the main client for specialized attacks.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">The target – configuring your target web applications</strong>: Our instructions for setting the target web server.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">The target – configuring your target-emulated devices</strong>: Our instructions for setting the targets for <strong class="bold">Internet of Things</strong> (<strong class="bold">IoT</strong>) testing.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Operating the lab</strong>: In this final section of this chapter, we will describe how this lab is intended to be operated, putting together the elements we have seen.</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-46"><a id="_idTextAnchor051"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>Despite involving strictly practical matters, there are no particular prerequisites for this chapter. However, we recommend familiarizing yourself with the main tools we will be using. All of these are free to use, so don't worry about costs. Here are the links to the tools:</p>

			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-47"><a id="_idTextAnchor052"/>Understanding the practical approach and introducing the main tools</h1>
			<p>One of the most important aspects in understanding attack techniques and, in general, vulnerabilities and cyberattacks, is exploring firsthand what conducting an attack means, and also <a id="_idIndexMarker099"/>evaluating the behavior of an exploited target to figure out what the best defensive solutions might be. This is one of the main principles of ethical hacking: understanding the matter from the point of view of a potential attacker means having a more complete picture of what is happening, all in line with the strategic concepts of "knowing your enemy," which leads ultimately to a strategic advantage. This section is all about this: performing attack tests in a controlled and safe environment to study and experience in person what SQL injection is all about.</p>
			<p>In order to achieve this level of expertise, a wide range of tools will be used. SQL injection is mostly a web-based vulnerability, and that means it could be exploited using a simple web browser, sending a specific input to interact with an application, as seen in the practical part of this book. Of course, performing these tests against real targets could be quite problematic, as it would require specific agreements and engagement rules for us not to cause harm to systems of companies or individuals. Performing attacks against a system without prior signed agreements is against the law, and we do not want or encourage anybody to commit crimes. For this reason, we will be introducing our first software that allows us to set up a controlled environment on our own computer, without attacking anyone else: virtualization software.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-48"><a id="_idTextAnchor053"/>Virtualization software</h2>
			<p>The first piece of our set of tools is made of virtualization software. Virtualization is the process of emulating <a id="_idIndexMarker100"/>hardware resources (that is, a computer system) totally through software. An emulated machine is called a VM and has, virtualized as software, the same components a computer would have, all by using the hardware resources of the host system through the emulation software. </p>
			<p>There are many possible solutions available, but we recommend two main solutions, as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">VMware Workstation</strong>—VM emulation industry-standard software provided by VMware. The free <a id="_idIndexMarker101"/>version is partially limited in functionality and can only be run on a single VM at a time. This is illustrated in the following screenshot:</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="figure-caption"><a id="_idTextAnchor054"/></p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.1 – VMWare Workstation main web page</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Oracle VirtualBox</strong> – VM emulation <a id="_idIndexMarker102"/>software by Oracle, freely available <a id="_idIndexMarker103"/>and easy to use for generic purposes (available at <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org">www.virtualbox.org</a>). This is illustrated in the following screenshot:</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="figure-caption"> </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer030" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B15632_03_002.jpg" alt="Figure 3.2 – Oracle VirtualBox main web page&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.2 – Oracle VirtualBox main web page</p>
			<p>The full version of VMware is, of course, the most complete solution, but Oracle VirtualBox is also well known <a id="_idIndexMarker104"/>among users worldwide. In any case, our lab setup requires virtualization software, so either of these is fine. Be sure to check the configuration section and follow the suggested steps.</p>
			<p>As for simulating mobile and IoT devices, the Android operating system can be easily emulated. We will later see how to set up the emulation correctly. </p>
			<p>After covering in general the foundation tool used to enable our lab setup, we now introduce one of the most important tools for ethical hacking, Kali Linux, which is a Linux distribution that we will use in our emulated environment for the client-side part.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-49"><a id="_idTextAnchor055"/>Kali Linux</h2>
			<p>Kali Linux is a Debian Linux distribution specifically for ethical hacking, penetration testing, and, in general, information security. Kali Linux is well known among information security experts because it offers <a id="_idIndexMarker105"/>a large selection of security tools that can be used to perform security testing and simulate cyberattacks. This array of tools is so popular and complete that it is even used by malicious attackers. We can't stress this enough: as ethical hackers, tests are to be performed exclusively on targets for which explicit consent of the owner has been agreed upon. This includes, of course, possible targets that the attacker themselves owns and intends to use in order to perform tests. For this reason, the simplest configuration is based on the use of a VM running this specific version of the Linux operating system, so that it can be used in the same virtualized environment of the emulated targets, whether they may be web applications or other targets.</p>
			<p>Kali Linux has more than 600 tools for computer security, ranging from hacking to network monitoring tools, which are included to cover the widest possible range of use cases for security professionals. Included in the suite are also some important tools for web application security, some of which are also specific to discovering and exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability. We will now cover some of them, as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">OWASP ZAP</strong>: <strong class="bold">ZAP</strong> stands <a id="_idIndexMarker106"/>for <strong class="bold">Zed Attack Proxy</strong>, and the name <a id="_idIndexMarker107"/>explains what it does: this software is used as a proxy while using a web browser, so that the behavior of a web <a id="_idIndexMarker108"/>application can be studied performing <strong class="bold">Dynamic Application Security Tests</strong> (<strong class="bold">DAST</strong>). Traffic sent through a web browser can be sent through ZAP, allowing it to analyze the communications in terms of requests and response and, thus, depending on the interactions, discover possible vulnerabilities, including SQL injection. ZAP has also a built-in scanner that sends pre-formatted requests to target websites and, depending on the respective responses, can identify vulnerabilities in web applications. OWASP ZAP is provided by OWASP, which supports security professionals around the world, enabling the development of a security community and worldwide cooperation, while also providing a shared and effective methodology for web application security testing. OWASP ZAP is shown in the following screenshot:</li>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.3 – OWASP ZAP – Zed Attack Proxy – web page</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Burp Suite</strong>: Burp Suite, by PortSwigger, is a set of web application security tools, similar to ZAP, but possibly richer in functionality. Some of its most useful modules are only <a id="_idIndexMarker109"/>available through its Pro version, however. Burp Suite is used in the same way as ZAP, like a proxy for web application-based attacks, and serves the same purpose. If you don't have Burp Suite Pro already, we recommend using OWASP ZAP for the purpose of the tests included in this book. Burp Suite is shown in the following screenshot:</li>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.4 – Burp Suite's main web page</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">sqlmap</strong>: sqlmap is the <a id="_idIndexMarker110"/>most well-known software for automated SQL injection. It is a command-line utility that can be used to identify and exploit possible SQL injection vulnerabilities on a web application. Its detection engine is very powerful and has been refined through the years, making it one of the most relevant tools for web application security testing. sqlmap is shown in the following screenshot:</li>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.5 – sqlmap's web page</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">SQLninja</strong>: SQLninja is <a id="_idIndexMarker111"/>another useful and powerful utility geared toward exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability against databases running Microsoft SQL Server, possibly taking over the backend altogether with more specific options that allow, ultimately, remote access to the database server. SQLninja is shown in the following screenshot: </li>

			<p>The last piece of our set of tools, which will be described in the next section, is the main enabler of our tests, as it serves as the server side of our emulated environment.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-50"><a id="_idTextAnchor056"/>Overview of the OWASP BWA project</h1>
			<p>OWASP keeps a plethora of sub-projects, fueled by the efforts of many people around the world, with the <a id="_idIndexMarker112"/>aim of improving the experience of security professionals around the globe and raising awareness of web application security issues. One of the problems that ethical hackers encounter is finding targets that are free to attack without consequence in order to put their knowledge to the test. In the past, some organizations, such as web application security software vendors, put specific web applications on the web to allow the testing of the capabilities of software, or just to educate the public on web application security in general. Some of these applications have been removed or have become progressively harder to find, probably because they were discontinued or were designed to test older versions of application security software. The <strong class="bold">OWASP BWA</strong> project <a id="_idIndexMarker113"/>was started to provide people with a collection of some of these web applications to be used as test targets during web application security tests. Those web applications are distributed through an Ubuntu Server VM that serves as a web server hosting the applications contained within.</p>
			<p>The project was discontinued in 2015, but the download of the VM is still available. The virtual environment provided is what we will be using as our target web applications. In the <em class="italic">The target–configuring your target web applications</em> section, we will see how to set up the machine.</p>
			<p>As this is are quite a large number of applications available (37, to be exact), we will be highlighting the ones that we think are the best fit for practicing SQL injection, both manual and automated.</p>
			<p>To have an idea of what the vulnerable web application selection hub will be, we added as a screenshot the selection menu that will be seen while accessing the active VM from your web browser. You will be able to see it once the target machine configuration is complete, so be sure not to miss the corresponding section (<em class="italic">The target – configuring your target web applications</em>). Have a look at the following screenshot:</p>

			<p>Here is <a id="_idIndexMarker114"/>a list of the main web applications we will go through in the practical section:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Mutillidae II</strong>: A test <a id="_idIndexMarker115"/>web application for guided training provided by OWASP. We've already seen this application for error triggering in <em class="italic">Chapter 2</em>, <em class="italic">Manipulating SQL – Exploiting SQL Injection</em>.

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.11 – Broken WordPress home page</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">OWASP Vicnum</strong>: A simple, very basic web application that shows how not applying <a id="_idIndexMarker120"/>security measures can be very damaging. We've seen this in <a href="B15632_02_Final_JC_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor031"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Manipulating SQL – Exploiting SQL Injection,</em> as well, but we will revisit it for the practical part.

			<p>Feel free to <a id="_idIndexMarker121"/>use the provided applications for testing, independently from the guide provided in this book. Practice makes perfect, and practicing in a controlled environment allows you to develop your skills at your own pace.</p>
			<p>The approach and the tools provided represent the arsenal at our disposal. Now, it's time to start the setup of our test environment so that we can finally begin the practical part.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-51"><a id="_idTextAnchor057"/>The attacker – configuring your client machine</h1>
			<p>In this section, we will show our recommendations in terms of configuration of the machine that will be used <a id="_idIndexMarker122"/>for conducting the offensive tests. Bear in mind that other options are possible (which will be described later), but our suggestions prioritize usability and cover a wide array of use cases.</p>
			<p>In this book, we will use a <a id="_idIndexMarker123"/>client machine running <strong class="bold">Kali Linux</strong>. Kali Linux is free to use and is available <a id="_idIndexMarker124"/>on the official Kali Linux website (<a href="http://www.kali.org">www.kali.org</a>) for download as a disk image that will be used on the first boot. Each image also includes the possibility to run the system in a <em class="italic">Live</em> environment, thus not requiring installation. Since we are using a VM lab to manage both the client and the server side, we will be using regular installation for the purpose of this guide. </p>
			<p>Among the possible download options, we recommend <em class="italic">Kali Linux 64-Bit</em> for the best compatibility with updated software; alternatively, <em class="italic">Kali Linux 32-Bit</em> can also be used if your host can't handle 64-bit virtualized systems properly. <em class="italic">Kali Linux Light</em> could also be used, but most of the software tools would need to be installed one by one. For security purposes, ensure that the SHA-256 hash of the file you downloaded from the site is the same as the one shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer041" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.13 – Kali Linux download page</p>
			<p>Once you have obtained the operating system image, it's time to set up your virtualized system. </p>
			<p>Even if VMware <a id="_idIndexMarker125"/>is widely considered as an industry standard for IT professionals, Oracle VirtualBox can also be used for the purpose of setting up a lab for testing without usage limitation. Both software solutions are valid and can be used without noticeable differences. For usability reasons, our tests will be conducted using the freely available Oracle VirtualBox, which is shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer042" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B15632_03_014.jpg" alt="Figure 3.14 – Oracle VirtualBox download page&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.14 – Oracle VirtualBox download page</p>
			<p>Once both the disk image of your choice and the virtualization software have been obtained, proceed to creating a new VM running Kali Linux.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-52"><a id="_idTextAnchor058"/>Creating a new client VM </h2>
			<p>Here, we are presenting a step-by-step guide to create a new VM using VirtualBox. There will be <a id="_idIndexMarker126"/>many steps in common with the configuration of both client and target virtual machines, so be sure to follow our step-by-step guide. Proceed as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Click on the appropriate <strong class="bold">Create New Virtual Machine</strong> button and complete the settings in the wizard, depending on the version of Kali Linux you previously downloaded (64- or 32-bit) by selecting <strong class="bold">Linux</strong> as the operating system and <strong class="bold">Other Linux (64-bit)</strong> as the distribution (we have included a screenshot of the creation wizard here). The process is illustrated in the following screenshot:<div id="_idContainer043" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/B15632_03_015.jpg" alt="Figure 3.15 – Our Kali test machine setup – file path and system selection&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.15 – Our Kali test machine setup – file path and system selection</p></li>
				<li>Once you have selected the version, you will be prompted to configure the technical settings of the machine. Depending on the performance of your host computer, select the appropriate allocated <strong class="bold">random-access memory</strong> (<strong class="bold">RAM</strong>) to your VM. 1,024 megabytes is the minimum requirement we recommend (the operating system alone requires about 512 megabytes to function properly). The process is illustrated in the following screenshot:<div id="_idContainer044" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/B15632_03_016.jpg" alt="Figure 3.16 – Our Kali test machine setup – memory settings&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.16 – Our Kali test machine setup – memory settings</p></li>
				<li>As for <a id="_idIndexMarker127"/>secondary memory, you will be prompted to select a virtual hard disk. We recommend a disk size of at 8 GB minimum, but as this will only be a testing VM, that should be enough anyway (Kali Linux takes up to 3 GB of disk space, just for the installation of the operating system). The process is illustrated in the following screenshot:<div id="_idContainer045" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/B15632_03_017.jpg" alt="Figure 3.17 – Our Kali test machine setup – hard drive settings&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.17 – Our Kali test machine setup – hard drive settings</p></li>
				<li>On the <a id="_idIndexMarker128"/>first startup, select the Kali Linux image you previously downloaded as boot-up media so as to start the installation of the operating system on the VM. Select the appropriate options in terms of language, access credentials, and desktop environment(s) of choice. Once the operating system installation process is complete, you will be free to use your virtual Kali Linux machine for testing.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Finally, we recommend installing the additional software that we mentioned earlier, in the <em class="italic">Kali Linux</em> subsection of the <em class="italic">Understanding the practical approach and introducing the main tools</em> section.</p>
			<p>First and foremost, ensure all your Kali application packages are updated and are the latest version available by running the following commands from the Terminal (ensure your Kali machine is connected to the internet first):</p>
			<p class="source-code">sudo apt-get update</p>
			<p class="source-code">sudo apt-get upgrade</p>
			<p>To install OWASP-ZAP, run the following command from your terminal:</p>
			<p class="source-code">sudo apt-get install zaproxy</p>
			<p>To install SQLninja, run the following command from your terminal:</p>
			<p class="source-code">sudo apt-get install sqlninja</p>
			<p>sqlmap should already be present on the default Kali distribution. However, run the following command too, just in case:</p>
			<p class="source-code">sudo apt-get install sqlmap</p>
			<p>Kali Linux <a id="_idIndexMarker129"/>offers many other security tools too, besides the ones we will be using in the practical section of this book. Feel free to explore them in a controlled and safe environment without damaging any third parties.</p>
			<p>Once the client VM setup is complete, we can proceed with the setup of our target VMs that will be used during our tests.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-53"><a id="_idTextAnchor059"/>The target – configuring your target web applications</h1>
			<p>In all of our tests, we will be using the Kali Linux installation we previously set up as the client side. In order <a id="_idIndexMarker130"/>to cover the cases previously described in this book (web application and IoT devices), we need multiple target configurations.</p>
			<p>First, we will show how to set up the VM that will be used as a testing target for web application-based SQL injection attacks, by using the web applications included in the OWASP BWA VM. In this case, the setup is quite simple and linear.</p>
			<p>Download the <a id="_idIndexMarker131"/>latest version of the OWASP BWA VM from the official OWASP website by following the link to Sourceforge, as reported on the OWASP BWA main page:</p>
			<p><a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/owaspbwa/files/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/owaspbwa/files/</a></p>
			<p>Unfortunately, in these last months, the OWASP BWA main page has been migrated to another platform, so it is only accessible as a poorly formatted page, awaiting to be moved to the new platform. You can find it at this URL: </p>
			<p><a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-broken-web-applications/migrated_content">https://owasp.org/www-project-broken-web-applications/migrated_content</a></p>
			<p>The OWASP BWA main page can be seen in the following screenshot:</p>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.18 – OWASP BWA download page on Sourceforge.net</p>
			<p>Select <strong class="bold">Download Latest Version</strong> from the Sourceforge page to start the download. This download may take some time due to the file size (1.8 GB), depending on your internet connection bandwidth.</p>
			<p>The downloaded <a id="_idIndexMarker132"/>file is a compressed folder, containing VM files and the hard drive image. Now, we will see how easy it is to configure the server VM, as it will be much easier than the client one.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-54"><a id="_idTextAnchor060"/>Creating the OWASP BWA VM</h2>
			<p>Proceed in a <a id="_idIndexMarker133"/>similar fashion to what we saw in the <em class="italic">Creating a new client VM</em> section, with the following steps: </p>

				<li value="1">Create a new VM using your emulation software (Linux, 64-bit) and set 1,024 MB of main memory. You can use <em class="italic">Figure 3.15</em> and <em class="italic">Figure 3.16</em> as a reference, since the options will be identical.</li>
				<li>Once you are prompted to select the virtual hard drive, choose an existing hard drive (in this case, the one provided in the <strong class="source-inline">OWASP BWA</strong> folder, <strong class="source-inline">OWASP Broken Web Apps-cl1.vmdk</strong>). The process is illustrated in the following screenshot:<div id="_idContainer047" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/B15632_03_019.jpg" alt="Figure 3.19 – Existing disk selection for the OWASP BWA VM&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.19 – Existing disk selection for the OWASP BWA VM</p></li>
				<li>Since the VM has <a id="_idIndexMarker134"/>a large number of security vulnerabilities, set it with a <strong class="bold">Host Only</strong> connection to make it visible only at a local IP address from your host machine. Go to the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> panel from the VirtualBox menu and configure the VM network adapter from the <strong class="bold">Network</strong> tab. The process is illustrated in the following screenshots:<div id="_idContainer048" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/B15632_03_020.jpg" alt="Figure 3.20 – a—The Settings option from VirtualBox main screen&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.20 – a—The Settings option from VirtualBox main screen</p><p>The <strong class="bold">Network</strong> panel the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> menu is shown as follows:</p><div id="_idContainer049" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/B15632_03_021.jpg" alt="Figure 3.21 – b—The Network panel in the Settings menu&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.21 – b—The Network panel in the Settings menu</p></li>
				<li>Once the VM is ready, you can access it at the IP shown on its screen. By accessing the IP address <a id="_idIndexMarker135"/>with your web browser, you can see the applications available, up and running, as in the selection hub shown in <em class="italic">Figure 3.7</em>. In the following screenshot, you can see what the server VM screen looks like after startup, showing the IP address to use to connect through HTTP to the web applications:</li>

			<p>This concludes the setup of the web application environment. In the following section, we will deal with other emulated devices.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-55"><a id="_idTextAnchor061"/>The target – configuring your target-emulated devices</h1>
			<p>We will now <a id="_idIndexMarker136"/>see how to set up mobile and IoT emulated devices.</p>
			<p>In terms of functionality, these devices have a more restricted range of operations: usually, IoT devices have very limited computational power, and usually rely on simple web services, stripped out of any rich graphical setting.</p>
			<p>Some applications <a id="_idIndexMarker137"/>from the OWASP BWA virtual web server can actually mimic this behavior by providing web server <strong class="bold">application programming interfaces</strong> (<strong class="bold">APIs</strong>). We can say that we have already set up some of the environment for web service interaction.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">A side note: the OWASP IoT security testing framework and IoTGoat projects</p>
			<p class="callout">An interesting approach to IoT Security Testing comes, once again, from OWASP: the IoT security testing framework was released this year, and provides a thorough methodology for assessing and testing vulnerabilities in IoT environments, in a similar fashion as in the web application and mobile application testing frameworks provided by OWASP.</p>
			<p class="callout">In conjunction with this new framework, OWASP released yet another useful tool for testing purposes, while keeping everything legal and in a controlled setting: the OWASP IoTGoat VM. This project presents, in some ways, the IoT homologue to the OWASP BWA project, by providing a deliberately vulnerable emulation of a device, with many vulnerabilities in the OWASP Top 10 IoT vulnerabilities. We think it's worth checking it out in any case, at the official GitHub page: <a href="https://github.com/OWASP/IoTGoat">https://github.com/OWASP/IoTGoat</a>.</p>
			<p>After dealing with web services and web application, which also constitute the main means of interacting with the world of IoT, we will be setting up our way to simulate mobile devices. To do so, we need a way to emulate a mobile application environment, including the client. </p>
			<p>First and foremost, we recommend the most famous editor for Android mobile applications, which is also free to use: Android Studio.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Android Studio</strong> is a complete developer environment for Android Mobile applications. It also provides <a id="_idIndexMarker138"/>a handy Android emulator, to test developed applications from the client perspective on the same computer you would use for programming. This is the main feature we will use for testing for SQL injection.</p>
			<p>Download Android <a id="_idIndexMarker139"/>Studio from the official website (<a href="https://developer.android.com/studio">https://developer.android.com/studio</a>) and proceed with the installation. Android Studio is shown <a id="_idIndexMarker140"/>in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer051" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B15632_03_023.jpg" alt="Figure 3.23 – Android Studio official download page&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.23 – Android Studio official download page</p>
			<p>From here, you'll have many options to choose from. Most of those are fine and can be selected as you like, but the most important feature we need from this is the Android emulator. Be sure to have it selected during installation. The process is illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer052" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B15632_03_024.jpg" alt="Figure 3.24 – Select Android virtual device as an option during the installation of Android Studio&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.24 – Select Android virtual device as an option during the installation of Android Studio</p>
			<p>Run Android Studio, to finalize installation at the first startup. Feel free to set your preferences, but you should be fine with the standard installation. Once everything is set, you will now <a id="_idIndexMarker141"/>have what you need to emulate a mobile application client. As you probably know, mobile applications usually consist of client applications for web services. For this reason, we need a way to deploy and emulate a web service. Many options would do, but we recommend one of the most popular Java environments for coders, which is Eclipse. This will be used to run simple Java code that we will be using for emulating web services we need for our mobile application to work.</p>
			<p>Before installing <a id="_idIndexMarker142"/>the Java environment, to make our web <a id="_idIndexMarker143"/>service work, we need to install two more items of software, as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Apache Tomcat</strong> (available at <a href="https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi">https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi</a>)</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">MySQL Community</strong> (available at<span class="Annotation-reference"> </span><a href="https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/">https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/</a>). In this case, select the custom installation to install only <strong class="bold">MySQL Server</strong> and <strong class="bold">MySQL Workbench</strong>, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer053" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B15632_03_025.jpg" alt="Figure 3.25 – Custom installation for MySQL&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.25 – Custom installation for MySQL</p>
			<p>After having <a id="_idIndexMarker144"/>installed both Tomcat and MySQL, go to the MySQL website, then go to the <strong class="bold">Download</strong> section and download the Java connector to work <a id="_idIndexMarker145"/>with Tomcat (<a href="https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/">https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/</a>). Be sure to select <strong class="bold">Platform Independent</strong> as the operating system. The process is illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer054" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B15632_03_026.jpg" alt="Figure 3.26 – Downloading the Java connector&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.26 – Downloading the Java connector</p>
			<p>After the download, move the file in the lib folder of the Apache Tomcat installation folder (usually, <strong class="source-inline">C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 9.0\lib</strong>).</p>
			<p>Finally, head to <a id="_idIndexMarker146"/>the official Eclipse download page (<a href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/</a>) and follow the instructions. This can be seen in the following screenshot: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer055" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B15632_03_027.jpg" alt="Figure 3.27 – The official Eclipse download page&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.27 – The official Eclipse download page</p>
			<p>In some <a id="_idIndexMarker147"/>cases, the installer might not find any <strong class="bold">Java Virtual Machine</strong> (<strong class="bold">JVM</strong>) installed on your computer. If that is the case, it should show a pop-up to ask you to browse for the missing file. Choose the option to browse for it from the pop-up <a id="_idIndexMarker148"/>and browse your computer, and point to a valid <strong class="source-inline">javaw.exe</strong> file. You should find it anyway in the <strong class="source-inline">jre\bin</strong> folder of your Android Studio installation folder.</p>
			<p>For our purpose, during the installation, select the <strong class="bold">Eclipse IDE for Enterprise Java Developer</strong> option: this is particularly useful as it includes all we need for deploying web services. This is shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer056" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B15632_03_028.jpg" alt="Figure 3.28 – Select the highlighted option during Eclipse installation&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.28 – Select the highlighted option during Eclipse installation</p>
			<p>At this point, installation <a id="_idIndexMarker149"/>should begin. Proceed with setting up your preferences in terms of path and accessibility.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-56"><a id="_idTextAnchor062"/>Operating the lab</h1>
			<p>Now that <a id="_idIndexMarker150"/>the components of the lab are fully set up, we are ready to make it work.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-57"><a id="_idTextAnchor063"/>Setting up the OWASP BWA lab </h2>
			<p>Here are <a id="_idIndexMarker151"/>the steps we suggest to set up the OWASP BWA part of the lab:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">First, run the OWASP BWA VM from VirtualBox. Once it has started, it should display the screen shown in <em class="italic">Figure 3.21</em>. By now, the full list of web applications can be accessed at the address shown on the screen on your computer.</li>
				<li>To use Kali Linux, run your Kali VM from VirtualBox. Keep in mind that as long as OWASP BWA is running with the current settings, it can also access the web applications available from BWA. This is illustrated in the following screenshot:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer057" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B15632_03_029.jpg" alt="Figure 3.29 – The OWASP BWA selection hub as seen from the Kali VM&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.29 – The OWASP BWA selection hub as seen from the Kali VM</p>
			<p>This way, any emulated device on your computer can connect to the OWASP BWA server, thus making it possible to test a various range of attacks. Obviously, manual attacks can also be carried out <a id="_idIndexMarker152"/>from the comfort of your own computer without using any VM. We will use Kali Linux mainly for advanced or automated attacks.</p>
			<p>As for Android Studio and Eclipse, we will deal with these more thoroughly during the next chapter, as we will be using those in some specific use cases. Anyway, in order to make the Android emulator work, we need to set up a virtual device first.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-58"><a id="_idTextAnchor064"/>Setting up an Android Virtual Device</h2>
			<p>Here we <a id="_idIndexMarker153"/>are setting up an <strong class="bold">Android Virtual Device</strong> (<strong class="bold">AVD</strong>) using <a id="_idIndexMarker154"/>Android Studio. Please follow our easy step-by-step guide given here:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Select the <strong class="bold">AVD Manager</strong> option from the main Android Studio screen. It should be at the upper right of the screen, as shown in the following screenshot:<div id="_idContainer058" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/B15632_03_030.jpg" alt="Figure 3.30 – AVD Manager in Android Studio&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.30 – AVD Manager in Android Studio</p></li>
				<li>Once in the <strong class="bold">AVD Manager</strong>, select <strong class="bold">Create Virtual Device…</strong>. You will then select the emulated model (Google Pixel 2 is usually the default selection: you can go for it). The process <a id="_idIndexMarker155"/>is illustrated in the following screenshot:<div id="_idContainer059" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/B15632_03_031.jpg" alt="Figure 3.31 – AVD Manager's main screen&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.31 – AVD Manager's main screen</p></li>
				<li>Once selected, you will need to select a system image. Choose <strong class="bold">Android 10</strong> from the recommended system images. The selected image will then be downloaded. Depending on your internet connection, this may take quite some time. The process is illustrated in the following screenshot:<div id="_idContainer060" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/B15632_03_032.jpg" alt="Figure 3.32 – System image selection for a new device&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.32 – System image selection for a new device</p></li>
				<li>After the download is complete, the <strong class="bold">AVD Manager</strong> main screen will list your newly configured emulated device.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The emulated <a id="_idIndexMarker156"/>device works exactly like a VM. It will replicate the functionality of an Android mobile device. This feature was devised specifically to test the runtime of developed Android applications. We will see some examples in the next chapter of this book.</p>
			<p>So, to sum it up: you can have all your targets running on your computer and perform all your tests without the need for physical machines or extra devices. However, in case you have constraints dictated by your machines such as limits for main memory, we recommend trying each of the scenarios separately in order not to overload your computer with too many virtualizations at once. However, systems settings for your VMs can be adjusted in accordance with your needs.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-59"><a id="_idTextAnchor065"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we set up the lab environment we need for running our tests. Here's a brief checklist of what we set up so far, with a recap of the tools we will be using.</p>
			<p>Our main tool for performing tests in an ethical setup is using virtualization software, to test our attack techniques without damaging any third parties while using free tools and software. </p>
			<p>Our main client for running web-based attacks, besides possibly our computer itself, will be a Kali Linux VM for advanced and automated attack techniques. To emulate a vulnerable target web server, we will be using the OWASP BWA VM, containing both traditional web applications vulnerable to SQL injection, and web service attack (<strong class="bold">representational state transfer</strong> (<strong class="bold">REST</strong>)) scenarios, on which other application models, such as IoT architectures, usually rely. Our mobile application scenarios will be run using Android Studio, using its built-in device emulator for the client, and a web service running on our computer itself.</p>
			<p>All these different scenarios can be run separately on our computer, without overloading our resources too much. In any case, settings can be customized depending on your limits and needs.</p>
			<p>The next chapter will be the core of the practical section, and will be centered on running, in a step-by-step approach, the attack techniques we saw in <a href="B15632_02_Final_JC_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor031"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Manipulating SQL – Exploiting SQL Injection</em> (and more). These will be performed against the same virtual environment we have seen in this chapter itself. </p>
			<p>We hope you'll have fun in the next chapter, as you will be getting hands-on experience with what we've seen so far.</p>
