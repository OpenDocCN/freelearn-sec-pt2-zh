    period.

- en: Our communication capabilities, the water that we drink every day, the energy
    that gives us light during the night and fuels the objects that makes our life
    better (such as washing machines), transportation, and the financial world are
    totally dependent on interconnected systems. These systems, in most cases, use
    software to manage data stored in databases, software that's accessible, normally,
    not only from internal but also external networks. This causes the most critical
    security problems.

- en: There is an attack every 39 seconds on average on the web, 30,000 new websites
    are hacked every day, and hackers steal 75 database records every second. Cyber-attackers
    have several vectors for breaking into web applications, but SQL injection continues
    to be by far their most popular choice. Akamai's State of the Internet report
    shows that **SQL injection** now represents nearly two-thirds (65.1%) of all web
    application attacks.

    and security testers will find, in the early stage of development, vulnerabilities
    that might lead to SQL injection.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is designed for two types of readers. It's primarily aimed at anyone
    who has basic programming experience (doesn't matter if it's in the mobile, web,
    or backend domain) and wants to add more value to their work with security capabilities
    for building more resilient software. Security practitioners are the second group
    for whom this book is designed. Using the information contained in this book,
    they will be able to better understand some of the most critical vulnerabilities
    that are used, every day, to hack systems around the world.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book follows a step-by-step approach; anyone can learn effective techniques
    to build highly secure software or a better application testing security posture,
    even when working on new topics, such as mobile and IoT.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 1*](B15632_01_Final_JC_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor020), *Structured
    Query Language for SQL Injection*, serves as a theoretical introduction to the
    topic, describing at a high level what SQL is, what it is used for, and its possible
    weaknesses that lead to SQL injection. This theoretical overview is crucial in
    order to understand concepts behind SQL injection such as database management
    systems, database models, and SQL.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 2*](B15632_02_Final_JC_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor031), *Manipulating
    SQL – Exploiting SQL Injection*, continues with the theoretical approach to the
    topic, getting more in touch with the practical aspects of SQL injection attacks.
    This chapter includes examples of input strings that could be used to trigger
    SQL injection for many different purposes.'
  prefs: []

- en: '[*Chapter 3*](B15632_03_Final_JC_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor050), *Setting Up
    the Environment*, covers the setup of the test environment that will be used in
    the core of the practical elements of this book, while also defining the main
    approach behind it.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 4*](B15632_04_Final_JC_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor069), *Attacking Web,
    Mobile, and IoT Applications*, deals, primarily, with SQL injection against traditional
    web applications, which is the most common context, using both manual and automated
    techniques, relying on the toolset we discuss in the previous chapter. We will
    see, moreover, how mobile applications and IoT devices can also be vulnerable
    to SQL injection attacks, showing practical examples.'

    SQL Injection with Defensive Solutions*, focuses on the defensive side of things:
    now that we know that such an impressive and destructive type of vulnerability
    exists – and how simple in principle it would be to exploit it – how can we stop
    it?'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 6*](B15632_06_Final_JC_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor102), *Putting It
    All Together*, serves as a review of what you learned in this book by summarizing
    and analyzing what we''ve seen, putting everything in a critical perspective and
    considering the broader implications not only of SQL injection, but also of security
    vulnerabilities in general, in a world that relies on information technology and
    data.'
