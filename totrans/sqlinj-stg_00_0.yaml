    that gives us light during the night and fuels the objects that makes our life
    better (such as washing machines), transportation, and the financial world are
    totally dependent on interconnected systems. These systems, in most cases, use
    software to manage data stored in databases, software that's accessible, normally,
    not only from internal but also external networks. This causes the most critical
    security problems.

- en: There is an attack every 39 seconds on average on the web, 30,000 new websites
    are hacked every day, and hackers steal 75 database records every second. Cyber-attackers
    have several vectors for breaking into web applications, but SQL injection continues
    to be by far their most popular choice. Akamai's State of the Internet report
    shows that **SQL injection** now represents nearly two-thirds (65.1%) of all web
    application attacks.

    and security testers will find, in the early stage of development, vulnerabilities
    that might lead to SQL injection.

- en: This book is designed for two types of readers. It's primarily aimed at anyone
    who has basic programming experience (doesn't matter if it's in the mobile, web,
    or backend domain) and wants to add more value to their work with security capabilities
    for building more resilient software. Security practitioners are the second group
    for whom this book is designed. Using the information contained in this book,
    they will be able to better understand some of the most critical vulnerabilities
    that are used, every day, to hack systems around the world.

    to build highly secure software or a better application testing security posture,
    even when working on new topics, such as mobile and IoT.

    Query Language for SQL Injection*, serves as a theoretical introduction to the
    topic, describing at a high level what SQL is, what it is used for, and its possible
    weaknesses that lead to SQL injection. This theoretical overview is crucial in
    order to understand concepts behind SQL injection such as database management
    systems, database models, and SQL.'

    topic, getting more in touch with the practical aspects of SQL injection attacks.
    This chapter includes examples of input strings that could be used to trigger
    SQL injection for many different purposes.'

    web applications, which is the most common context, using both manual and automated
    techniques, relying on the toolset we discuss in the previous chapter. We will
    see, moreover, how mobile applications and IoT devices can also be vulnerable
    to SQL injection attacks, showing practical examples.'

    exists – and how simple in principle it would be to exploit it – how can we stop
    it?'

    considering the broader implications not only of SQL injection, but also of security
    vulnerabilities in general, in a world that relies on information technology and
