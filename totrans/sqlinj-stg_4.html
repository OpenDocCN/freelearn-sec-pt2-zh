				<li>A database is a way to store data in a permanent way, usually in a structured and accessible way so that its content can be easily queried.</li>
				<li>A relational database is a database that uses tables to store data. These tables model objects and the relations among them, as the name suggests.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Structured Query Language </strong>(<strong class="bold">SQL</strong>) is a language responsible for interacting with relational databases and relies on building queries with a straightforward syntax.</li>
				<li>Some examples of SQL-based systems include MySQL, SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server, and Oracle Database.</li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">SELECT</strong> is the most common SQL statement as it's responsible for querying a database to return data based on specified requirements.</li>
				<li>SQL injection is an attack that involves inserting, through inputted data, arbitrary SQL commands. This may result in otherwise restricted operations against a database being used by the target application.</li>
			</ol>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-107"><a id="_idTextAnchor118"/>Chapter 2</h1>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">SQL injection can be triggered through the use of specific characters that correspond, in SQL syntax, to specific functionalities, such as string delimiters, to terminate input strings before they are intended to. This inserts SQL code afterward, as well as comment characters, to make the system ignore entire parts of a query.</li>
				<li>An attacker could use a web form to insert arbitrary queries to return possibly relevant information. They could query default tables to see the database structure by appending the results to existing query results using <strong class="source-inline">UNION</strong>, as well as by commenting out the part of the query that would be used after the input was included.</li>
				<li>There are two ways in which an attacker could defeat user authentication: they could retrieve the password from a previous injection attack against the database, or they could trick the application by inserting an always true statement, resulting in a login success.</li>
				<li>Blind SQL injection is a SQL injection technique that does not rely on database output. It could rely on Boolean expressions, provided that the application behaves differently in the case of true or false results, or it could introduce time delays if the application does not show any difference in the output.</li>
				<li>Since there is no significant output difference in the case of true or false results, all we can do is rely on time-based SQL injection.</li>
				<li>Virtually any database system that relies on queries, if the input has not been sanitized or validated, could be vulnerable to injection attacks.</li>
			</ol>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-108"><a id="_idTextAnchor119"/>Chapter 3</h1>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Virtualization software is a special kind of software that fully emulates systems. We use it so that our tests do not involve other external parties. This means we do everything in a controlled setting.</li>
				<li>Kali Linux is a special Linux distribution that includes a suite of software for security professionals. We need it to show automated SQL injection attacks against web applications.</li>
				<li>The OWASP BWA project is a collection, in the form of a virtual machine, of purposely vulnerable web apps. We typically use it as a target for our web application attacks.</li>
				<li>We emulate web services, which represent a different interface with respect to traditional web applications, and mobile devices, which show the vulnerability in a mobile setting.</li>
				<li>Absolutely not. Only test against systems that belong to you. Never test on systems that belong to third parties without prior explicit and formally expressed consent (that is, a contract).</li>
			</ol>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-109"><a id="_idTextAnchor120"/>Chapter 4</h1>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Binary Search can be especially useful while performing blind SQL injection for guessing characters one by one using, for example, MySQL's <strong class="source-inline">ascii()</strong> function.</li>
				<li>Inserting a SQL query inside the argument of a function that relies on external languages/module (as in the <strong class="source-inline">ExtractValue()</strong> function) might return the result of the query inside the SQL error.</li>
				<li>OWASP ZAP provides the Spider tool, which is used to identify web pages and potentially vulnerable forms, and the Scan and Fuzzer tools, which can be used to check for vulnerable parameters.</li>
				<li>Yes. sqlmap has a password cracking module that can be used extract passwords from hashes via bruteforcing.</li>
				<li>SQL injection can be performed against any type of application, including web applications, web services, and mobile applications, as shown in this chapter.</li>
			</ol>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-110"><a id="_idTextAnchor121"/>Chapter 5</h1>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">User input should be always considered potentially malicious, so it always needs to be sanitized and validated.</li>
				<li>Validating input means deciding if it's valid or not before it's accepted. Blacklisting blocks all known invalid input, while whitelisting only accepts known valid input.</li>
				<li>Parameterized queries are a way to build query statements that consist of breaking the query strings in parameters. These are first stored as variables and then inserted into the query's body.</li>
				<li>Character encoding and escaping are useful for transforming harmful characters that could otherwise be interpreted by SQL causing SQL injection.</li>
				<li>The purpose of a <strong class="bold">Web Application Firewall</strong> (<strong class="bold">WAF</strong>) is to filter requests at the application level, as well as to identify and prevent dangerous requests from reaching the application.</li>
				<li>No. If an attacker gains access to the encrypted data, they could also obtain the encryption key, thus rendering encryption useless.</li>
			</ol>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-111"><a id="_idTextAnchor122"/>Chapter 6</h1>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Security flaws are usually the result of errors in code, wrong configurations, or issues in a protocol.</li>
				<li>Security professionals, when testing vulnerabilities, have to evaluate the exploitability of vulnerabilities, thus properly assessing their impact and risk.</li>
				<li>First, the vulnerabilities are discovered. After discovery comes testing, to assess its risk. Finally, the remediation plan is developed based on the risks identified.</li>
				<li>SQL injection, despite being an old vulnerability, can still be found in the wild, and can still be an issue nowadays.</li>
				<li>SQL injection, being an injection issue, is at the top of the OWASP Top 10 for Web Application Security Risks list.</li>
