<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Preface</h1>
<p>Maybe you’ve just finished a boot camp on ethical hacking and you can’t get enough. Perhaps you’re an administrator who has realized that it’s time to understand how the bad guys work with these dark arts. It’s also possible that someone gave you this book for your birthday after misunderstanding when you said you have a keen interest in den nesting. Whoever you are (except for that last one), this book is for you. But why this book?</p>
<p>Let’s be honest: this subject has a tendency to be dry. Sometimes, it feels like an author is there to just tell us how it is, providing a sparse foundation of the concepts under discussion. I think the experience is more enjoyable if it feels more like an interactive learning session than a lecture. So, I’ve endeavored to discuss pen testing in a more conversational and relaxed manner. Reading this book should feel like we’re just hanging out in the lab and exploring these concepts. I think the kids these days call this vibing. I’ll have to ask my nieces.</p>
<p>This book isn’t intended for complete beginners, but it is accessible to different levels of experience. Overall, it is assumed that you have some experience and education in information technology and cybersecurity. This book won’t “teach you how to hack,” and in fact, many of the labs feature old attacks that aren’t likely to succeed in a real-world environment. The foundation they all provide, however, is very much still relevant. The lessons will be valuable to those who intend to understand how the core concept works, and from there, they can be translated into modern attacks. This book emphasizes understanding over blindly following steps.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>Who this book is for</h1>
<p>This book is for penetration testers, IT professionals, and individuals breaking into the pen testing role after demonstrating an advanced skill in boot camps. Prior experience with Windows, Linux, and networking is useful.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>What this book covers</h1>
<p><a href="B17616_01_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Open Source Intelligence</em>, provides a look at how to use publicly available resources such as Google to gather surprisingly useful information about a target.</p>

<p><a href="B17616_11_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor205"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></a>, <em class="italic">Shellcoding – Bypassing Protections</em>, jumping off from the stack foundation in <a href="B17616_10_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor187"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></a><em class="italic">, Shellcoding – The Stack</em>, explores how defenders have responded and how attacks such as return-oriented programming had to adapt to these responses.</p>
<p><a href="B17616_12_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor224"><em class="italic">Chapter 12</em></a>, <em class="italic">Shellcoding – Evading Antivirus</em>, explores how antimalware can be confused when we live off the land with PowerShell, and an alternative to Shellter’s dynamic injection approach: cave jumping.</p>

<p><a href="B17616_15_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor277"><em class="italic">Chapter 15</em></a>, <em class="italic">Going Beyond the Foothold</em>, looks at the first steps after we finally establish our initial foothold in our target, including how to conduct recon and further attacks from that privileged position.</p>
<p><a href="B17616_16_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor292"><em class="italic">Chapter 16</em></a>, <em class="italic">Escalating Privileges</em>, provides a more in-depth look at how we can escalate privileges locally with Metasploit, as well as finding and using passwords – even when we don’t know what the password is.</p>
<p><a href="B17616_17_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor314"><em class="italic">Chapter 17</em></a>, <em class="italic">Maintaining Access</em>, takes a look at how we can persist once we’ve made it inside the target environment, both from scratch with the target’s built-in abilities and with specialized tools for building reboot-resistant access.</p>
<p><em class="italic">Answers</em> can be used to check your knowledge by providing the answers to the quizzes at the end of each chapter.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-9"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
<p>The intent of this book is to emphasize Kali’s off-the-shelf capabilities as much as possible. Many commercial products are not mentioned, or if they are mentioned, free alternatives are reviewed in the labs (e.g., the free version of Shellter versus Shellter Pro). Today’s professional penetration tester has a wealth of excellent commercial tools in their toolset, but you can be an effective pen tester with what’s already freely available. Per The Hacker Manifesto, this was our intention with these discussions.</p>
<p>The version of Kali Linux used in this book is 2021.1; however, closer to the publishing date, I reviewed the labs with 2022.1 and found no issues. The processor and stack discussions assume a 32-bit operating system.</p>
<p>Kali Linux is free to download. However, Windows is a paid operating system. Thankfully, Microsoft provides evaluation copies of Windows Server and Edge developer copies of Windows 7 and 10; these were used as Windows targets in the labs.</p>
<p>The virtualization used was VMware Workstation, which is paid software. You can build comparable environments with the freeware Oracle VirtualBox.</p>
