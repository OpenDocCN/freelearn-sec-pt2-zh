- en: Maybe you’ve just finished a boot camp on ethical hacking and you can’t get
    enough. Perhaps you’re an administrator who has realized that it’s time to understand
    how the bad guys work with these dark arts. It’s also possible that someone gave
    you this book for your birthday after misunderstanding when you said you have
    a keen interest in den nesting. Whoever you are (except for that last one), this
    book is for you. But why this book?

- en: 'Let’s be honest: this subject has a tendency to be dry. Sometimes, it feels
    like an author is there to just tell us how it is, providing a sparse foundation
    of the concepts under discussion. I think the experience is more enjoyable if
    it feels more like an interactive learning session than a lecture. So, I’ve endeavored
    to discuss pen testing in a more conversational and relaxed manner. Reading this
    book should feel like we’re just hanging out in the lab and exploring these concepts.
    I think the kids these days call this vibing. I’ll have to ask my nieces.'

- en: This book isn’t intended for complete beginners, but it is accessible to different
    levels of experience. Overall, it is assumed that you have some experience and
    education in information technology and cybersecurity. This book won’t “teach
    you how to hack,” and in fact, many of the labs feature old attacks that aren’t
    likely to succeed in a real-world environment. The foundation they all provide,
    however, is very much still relevant. The lessons will be valuable to those who
    intend to understand how the core concept works, and from there, they can be translated
    into modern attacks. This book emphasizes understanding over blindly following
    steps.

- en: The intent of this book is to emphasize Kali’s off-the-shelf capabilities as
    much as possible. Many commercial products are not mentioned, or if they are mentioned,
    free alternatives are reviewed in the labs (e.g., the free version of Shellter
    versus Shellter Pro). Today’s professional penetration tester has a wealth of
    excellent commercial tools in their toolset, but you can be an effective pen tester
    with what’s already freely available. Per The Hacker Manifesto, this was our intention
    with these discussions.
