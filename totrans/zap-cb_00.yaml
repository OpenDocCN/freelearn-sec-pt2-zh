- en: OWASP ZAP is primarily for web application security professionals, developers,
    educators, and hackers. It is a powerful tool that can be used to identify and
    exploit vulnerabilities in web applications, making it an important tool for anyone
    who is responsible for the security of web-based systems.

- en: It’s worth noting that while OWASP ZAP can be used to identify and exploit vulnerabilities,
    it is not intended to be used to carry out malicious attacks or compromise systems
    without permission. The tool is designed to help organizations identify and fix
    vulnerabilities in their web applications, not to facilitate unauthorized access
    or other malicious activities. Therefore, it is important that users of the tool
    understand and adhere to ethical hacking principles when using the tool.
